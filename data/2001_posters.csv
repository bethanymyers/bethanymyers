"Ask ELIS and SearchDoc: information specialists at your desktop","Peggy W. Westlake, coordinator, Online Information Services; Dawn Williams, coordinator, Online Evidence Based Services; Nunzia Giuse, M.D., director; and Frances H. Lynch, AHIP, associate director; Eskind Biomedical Library, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN","Incorporating information into practice and optimizing resource utilization are important issues in today’s health care climate. The proliferation of varied electronic products and methods of access complicate efficient use of information. To facilitate effective information use at point of need, Vanderbilt’s Eskind Biomedical Library expands the librarian’s role as instructor, search mentor, and information provider using two asynchronous Web-based reference services—Ask ELIS and SearchDoc—which partner pagers and the Web to reach non-traditional patrons. Ask ELIS and SearchDoc accept unlimited queries twenty-four hours a day and provide Web-linked responses to the researcher’s desktop, the student’s home office, the nurses’ station, or the physician’s clinic in a reusable, archival format. Notified of the question via pager and email, the Ask ELIS and SearchDoc librarians email an answer or triage the query to the most knowledgeable source, whether part of the library or not. Answers to queries include linked Websites and targeted search strategies that can be copied into suggested databases or search engines; answers are not limited to information within the library’s traditional purview but expand to unaffiliated Websites, university departments, and agencies and organizations. Data collected provides essential information for collection development, training, technical access planning, and Web design to further promote the library’s expanded presence.",
"Enhancing instructions in EndNote for a biomedical community","Patricia A. Carney, reference librarian, and James Comes, associate director, Lamar Soutter Library, University of Massachusetts–Worchester","The advent of the Internet and the resulting information explosion mandates that researchers have the means to manage information at the local level. Bibliographic management tools such as EndNote offer the researcher the means to accomplish this goal. The Lamar Soutter Library Reference Department, through a customer service initiative, has developed a supportive training and instructional program utilizing EndNote. Needs and interests of the students and faculty for a bibliographic management tool were surveyed informally through the library’s Liaison Program and the Reference Desk. The survey identified minimal knowledge of bibliographic management tools and inefficient and time-consuming manual practices used to manage citations. This poster describes a program developed to provide a timeand labor-saving means to systematically collect, apply, and manage information for grant applications, journal submissions, and various other research activities. The goals were: • to have each member of the Reference Department become part of a resource group with the ability to teach, support, and promote the use of EndNote to develop strategies and activities to promote the program to support patrons converting existing bibliographies to EndNote libraries to create an email discussion list to support users of the program One member of the department was assigned to learn EndNote and develop a train-the-trainer program. Nursing and departments within the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences were selected and offered introductory programs. Contact with users of EndNote made it evident that they were not using the program to its full potential. Reeducation became part of the plan as well as providing fixes when users experienced glitches. An advanced program was developed to teach broader information-management skills. Marketing was done through personal contact with department heads, the Liaison Program, communication with active researchers, new faculty, the Office of Research, the Office of Medical Education, and various in-house print media. The program will be evaluated through a survey in the spring of 2001, and the findings will be reported."
"Utilizing patron trends to target and meet patron needs","Kathleen Bauer, reference librarian, Yale University, Cushing/Whitney Medical Library, New Haven, CT","Purpose: Describe the provision of reference services in the context of other trends in the library. Examine and analyze statistical data to target and develop marketing materials for remote users. Setting: Cushing/Whitney Medical Library service points: the reference desk, circulation desk, historical library, and remote access points. Methodology: Data gathered during two randomly selected days each month to measure reference and circulation trends. Other data gathered using Web server analysis, data from vendors, and Ovid and electronic journal use. Results: Reference questions transacted away from the reference desk accounted for a statistically significant portion of all reference activity in the library. When looking at reference transactions occurring at the desk and remotely, 20% of the in-depth reference questions and 13.8% of the technical questions were handled remotely. A larger portion of remote activity consisted of in-depth reference or technical transactions (36.2% of all remote transactions versus 24% of questions at the desk). In overall library statistics, the usage of electronic resources showed rapid growth (55.6% increase in use of Ovid full text journals and 36.8% increase in use of electronic textbooks), while circulation of print materials and activity at the reference desk continued to decline (-8.3% and -11% respectively). Discussion/Conclusion: These results indicate that a major shift has occurred in the way patrons are using the Cushing/Whitney Medical Library. The patron has become increasingly likely to use the library through its Website and its electronic resources. This trend will continue as more journals and textbooks are delivered electronically to patrons and will accelerate in the near future as the library begins to cancel print subscriptions. To remain relevant and useful to patrons, reference staff must work to serve patrons at remote and electronic access points. The library must be proactive in examining the needs, behaviors, and expectations of remote users and to increase the library’s visibility by developing new marketing techniques to reach the remote user.",
"Search templates versus filters: comparative experiences in identifying information on","Mary W. Wood, librarian, Center for Animal Alternatives, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California–Davis; and Stuart J. Nelson, M.D., head, Medical Subject Headings Section, National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD","Background: Information on realistic alternatives to using animals in teaching and research is dispersed in a wide range of literature and the search for that information can be elusive. Biomedical researchers are required to search for alternatives; however, their results are usually less than satisfactory. In order to assist the research scientist, the center has developed many tools and resources. The most recent development at the center has been the creation of templates, stored search strategies on a variety of topics, which are embedded in a Web document and accessible by all. Another way to assist the user in narrowing a search to only the most useful documents is by the use of search filters. Search filters enable a user to combine the filter with an area of interest to formulate a sophisticated search strategy. NLM has had success with the MEDLINE search filters in Clinical Queries. The potential advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches were explored. Methodology: Prototypes of filters and templates were developed for a variety of analogous topics. In some cases, the analogous approach for several templates was included in a single filter strategy. Results of retrievals from MEDLINE searching were then compared. Results/Outcome: Technology is allowing for ever-increasing sophistication while assisting users in locating information. Search templates have proven to be a useful tool in the search for very specific alternatives information. However, maintenance of the templates and providing a sufficient number to address the large number of potential searches that may be needed by researchers presents a logistical problem. The development of search filters would perhaps allow for a wider application and a broader approach to the subject. Difficulties include training the users of the filters about their appropriate use, some loss of specificity in the retrieval, and ensuring that optimal search strategies are being used."
"A team odyssey: creating a PubMed Web tutorial for use outside the classroom","Tara M. Tobin, reference librarian; Barbara W. Francis, AHIP, reference librarian; Health Science Center Libraries, University of Florida– Gainesville; Susan McCullough, coordinator, Education, Borland Library, University of Florida–Jacksonville; and Ramona Miller, reference librarian, Library, Santa Fe Community College, Gainesville, FL","Setting: The University of Florida Health Science Center Libraries (HSCL) include a large, academic library with the main branch and a Veterinary Medicine Reading Room in Gainesville, FL, and the Borland Library in Jacksonville, FL. The libraries serve the six health sciences center colleges of medicine, dentistry, nursing, pharmacy, health professions, and veterinary medicine. Project Description: In 1999, a group of interested librarians at the HSCL met to begin the creation of a Web-based tutorial for their distance and on-campus clients to use outside the classroom setting. Based on several criteria, they chose the National Library of Medicine’s PubMed database for this project. Using the various expertise and levels of experience of the participants to their best advantage, this team created a user-friendly, Web-based tutorial and launched it in February of 2000. This presentation will address the creation process, what worked and what did not and the importance of teamwork. Results: The tutorial is a continual work in progress as PubMed itself develops and changes. It has been well received by the Health Science Center Libraries’ community as well as national and international institutions. The tutorial is benefiting students and residents on rotations outside of Gainesville who would not otherwise get instruction and also serves as a refresher for those who have had classroom instruction. Evaluation: Periodic reports of the tutorial’s user base are done. A feedback form on the tutorial itself provides valuable information as well as suggestions for improvements and enhancements."
"Studies on Canadian eye care information on the Web","Ruiling Guo, medical librarian, Medical Library, Henan Institute of Ophthalmology, Zhengzhou, China ; and Jochen Moehr, School of Health Information Science, University of Victoria, Victoria, Canada","Purpose: Investigate Canadian eye care organizations on the Web, evaluate and compare their Websites’ features and design, and analyze the information the eye care Websites provide. Methodology: A search of the Web for selecting eye care organizations was conducted, and twenty-nine were determined to be assessment sources. Two instruments for assessment were used. The quantitative assessment instrument was done with a checklist of features containing forty-four items, which were grouped into four sections: general information, site design and technical aspects, eye care information, and external links and interactive tools. The qualitative assessment instrument was the categorical rating scale on which the Websites were rated on ten dimensions. Results: In this study, it was found that there was a strong correlation (r = 0.89, P < 0.001) between the number of features investigated at a Website and its score on the categorical rating scale. As compared with the universities and their affiliations, eye companies had more features on site design and technical aspects with attractive graphics and more features on common eye problems and surgical treatment. Eye problems, eye health education and training, and finding eye care professionals had higher scores. On the contrary, the information on eye research had lower scores. Discussion/Conclusion: The present study indicates that twenty-nine eye care Websites have provided much eye health information for patients, the general public, and health care providers. Through these Websites, very useful resources, such as common ocular problems, diagnosis, treatment and prevention, online seminars, latest news on eye education, finding eye doctors, and so on can be accessible, although each eye site has a distinct goal on its own. The two instruments used were shown helpful in evaluating the eye Websites. It is suggested that some aspects in designing an eye Website might be improved and some contents should be included."
"Repetitive strain injuries: a survey of medical libraries in Southern California and Arizona","Terri J. Ottosen, AHIP, information specialist, Norris Medical Library, University of Southern California–Los Angeles","Purpose: This poster will report on the prevalence and rate of incidence of repetitive strain injuries in medical library workers. Setting/Subjects: 164 medical libraries in Southern California and Arizona are surveyed to determine the extent of the problem among professional and paraprofessional staff. Methodology: Questionnaire. Results: Many studies have been conducted on the problem of repetitive strain injuries (RSIs) and ergonomics among library workers. An even greater number of studies have focused on the problem in other industries. Previous research examined the types of injuries, results of institutional efforts to prevent RSIs, personal narratives of afflicted workers, and ergonomic issues such as job and workstation design. This poster will analyze the results of a survey to establish a baseline measurement of RSIs in medical libraries, including the number of employees affected, their job titles, specific job duties, area of the body affected, medical diagnosis, treatments given, and necessity of modifying the employee’s duties as a result. Discussion/Conclusion: Survey analysis estimates the amount of lost work hours and those activities that cause the greatest potential for injury. The information derived from the survey will be helpful in future research to determine whether these types of injuries are increasing and if the rates found in medical libraries are similar to those in the public library sector."
"Informatics training to prepare faculty for a new case-based medical school curriculum","Kelly M. Moore, coordinator, Health Information Education, Louis Calder Memorial Library; Carmen Bou Rivera, coordinator, Library Services, and head, Pomerance Library and Resource Center, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences; and Joaquin Arriaga, director, Reference and Education Services, Louis Calder Memorial Library; School of Medicine; University of Miami–Miami","Purpose: To identify core competencies and develop educational programs in medical informatics that effectively prepare clinical and research faculty for a new case-based curriculum at the school of medicine. Settings/Subjects: Department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences faculty at a private academic medical center with a publicly funded teaching hospital within a large urban community. Methodology: Based on the core competencies in medical informatics identified by Florance at the University of Rochester and a needs assessment of department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, faculty, library and departmental faculty and administrators identified four competencies needed by faculty in preparation for a case-based curriculum: computer literacy, communications, information management, and computer-aided learning. Library faculty then identified members of the library faculty and staff with the required skills to develop and implement a series of eleven one-and-one-half-hour sequential classes for the four competencies. A total of sixty-eight classes were given during a six-week period to small groups of two to three faculty members at times convenient to the faculty members. The classes emphasized computer applications and skills, utilized the most current technology, and included demonstrations and hands-on exercises. Results/Discussion: Department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences faculty acquired and began to improve the health informatics competencies needed to effectively teach in the new case-based curriculum to be implemented in the fall 2001. A cadre of six instructors with a high skill level in one or more of the core competencies was required to implement the sixty-eight classes and ensure optimal learning. Evaluation: Responses and comments to an anonymous questionnaire distributed to faculty who participated in the training indicated a high level of satisfaction with the training in four core competencies in health informatics."
"Consumer health information for California: collaborating for access","Elisa Cortez, reference librarian; Carlene Bogle, chair, Public Services; Marissa Smith, Del E. Webb Library, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA; and Heidi Thiessen Sandstrom, coordinator, Consumer Health Information Services, Pacific Southwest Regional Medical Library, University of California–Los Angeles","Purpose: The purpose of this project was to facilitate access to health information in public libraries. The speakers will discuss the development of the project and the resources used to support collection development and training. They will show participants how they can effect collaboration and use these resources with public libraries in their communities. Brief Description: The project demonstrates how the knowledge and expertise of health sciences librarians can be utilized to assist public library staff in more effectively answering consumer health information questions in the public library setting. The librarians developed a core list of recommended materials and a series of three basic workshop modules that were used to enhance collections and train staff. Results/Outcome: After completion of the original project with the city library system, the project was subsequently expanded to include public libraries in a contiguous five-county region. Evaluation Method: An evaluation form was used to obtain feedback from the workshop participants. Use statistics were collected on the core materials placed in the libraries."
"Going from one extreme to the other: a rationale for total cost recovery","Suzanne Grefsheim, executive director, National Institutes of Health, NIH Library, Bethesda, MD","Purpose: This poster will report on the rationale used to recover costs for all library services directly from National Institutes of Health (NIH) and centers and on initial reactions to this change in how the library is funded. Setting/Participants/Resources: The NIH Library supports the information needs of clinical and basic researchers working at the NIH. In recent years, as the library has expanded access to electronic resources and services, demands for access to them has grown significantly. Brief Description: As part of an organization-wide initiative, a new demand-driven "business model" was developed for implementation in Fiscal Year 2001 that responds to an expanding user base and the higher costs associated with providing a dynamic digital library presence at NIH. The old funding model relied on numbers of researchers with physical access to the library. The source of the funds was a centrally collected "tax" on the appropriations of all institutes and centers (ICs), which was then redistributed to central service units like the library. There was no connection between use of a service and how much an institute paid. Nor was there a provision to expand access to a service beyond the main campus. Under the new business model, charges for selected services for which accurate data is available are based on a three-year history of use by IC staff. However, the costs of acquiring, providing access to, and facilitating use of the library’s print and electronic collections could not be allocated in this fashion. All IC staff are potential users, so costs for these services and resources are based on census. Results/Outcomes: Service agreements assessing each IC with a portion of the library’s total operating budget were sent in September 2000. Signed agreements initiated the billing process in October, the beginning of the fiscal year. Evaluation Method: The library’s ability to continue expanding its digital resources and services under this new funding model will be a critical indicator of success."
"Using dynamic Web technologies to collaboratively develop an inter-institutional consumer health Website","Gerald Perry, AHIP, head, Information Services; and Kristin Antelman, head, Systems and Networking; Arizona Health Sciences Library, University of Arizona–Tucson","Purpose: This presentation describes the University of Arizona, Arizona Health Sciences Library’s history using Web application server software, focusing on key knowledge gained with each successive project. It will describe the library’s most recent project, involving Web-based forms for onand off-campus update and modification of content to a backend database to support a collaborative, inter-institutional consumer health information Website. Setting/Participants/Resources: Staff at the Arizona Health Sciences Library have been using Web application server software to deliver enhanced dynamic functionality for a variety of Website projects. With each iteration, library staff has been able to apply a growing body of knowledge about this technology and its uses. The first project involved creating dynamic content for the library’s Website, integrating several Microsoft Access backend databases and using Allaire’s Cold Fusion Web application server software. For the second project, once again involving Cold Fusion, staff were able to deliver access to more than 1,500 diverse Web-based information resources on behalf of a thirty-plus member statewide consortium of health care institutions. The consortium site featured an increase in database design complexity, with the library moving to a single Microsoft SQL Server database. The result was a significant increase in the site’s functionality and navigability. Brief Description: The library’s latest, "third generation" Web application server project found the staff collaboratively developing a Website for a consumer health information initiative involving the library and the regional public library system. Library staff once again used Cold Fusion, a single SQL Server database, a more ambitious model for creating a fully database-driven Website, and introduced a Web form for delivering content into the backend database to allow off-campus partners to participate in developing and maintaining the Website’s content. Results/Outcomes/Evaluations: A usability study will be launched jointly by the Arizona Health Sciences Library and the regional public library to gauge the effectiveness of the jointly developed Website, focusing on ease of navigation and ability to locate information as needed. This third generation initiative has already proved successful, however, in that library staff have developed the skills to permit multi-site, offnetwork collaboration on Web-based database projects."
"Transforming interlibrary loans for the digital library","Karen A. Butter, AHIP, deputy director, Library and Center for Knowledge Management, University of California–San Francisco","Purpose: This poster will report on a restructuring of the interlibrary loans process as part of a major focus on resource sharing within the University of California (UC). Two components of the initiative include an aggressive program to license electronic content and the development and implementation of a system that automates the requesting and fulfillment process for faculty and students and improves workflow for library staff. With custom programming, the integration of a commercial system and changes in policies and procedures, Request adds a new level of functionality to the California Digital Library. Setting/Participants/Resources: This project is under the leadership of the California Digital Library, a collaborative effort of the University of California campuses, five of which are academic health sciences centers. Brief Description: California’s economic downturn in the 1990s plus the rising cost of information brought a renewed focus on resource sharing for the University of California system. A new service, Request, was built upon technology to facilitate the request and transmission of print materials from one campus to another and development of systems that allow faculty and students to easily access information from the university’s shared digital collections. The automatic user-initiated Request for materials located on other campuses was established in January 1999 to support the efficient sharing of print collections across all UC campuses. Results/Outcome: Request quickly gained widespread acceptance from UC faculty and students. UC library staff, who have been instrumental in its design, acknowledge its value in improving the efficiency of operations. Evaluation Method: Throughout the multiyear project objective and subjective studies have been conducted. The results of evaluation studies will be presented including suggestions for future development."
"How computer literate are first-year medical students? Results of an online assessment","Susanne Markgren, reference librarian; Lynn Kasner Morgan, AHIP, assistant dean, Information Resources and Systems, and library director; Alan Krissoff, reference coordinator; Lynn Peperone, reference librarian; and Pauline Beam, reference librarian; Levy Library, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY","Purpose: This poster will discuss an online computer and informatics assessment given to first-year medical students at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. It will cover the reason we chose to conduct the assessment over the Web and its development, implementation, and results. Setting/Participation: Using Web CT, the institutional platform for delivering Web-based education, we developed the Computer, Internet, and Library Skills Assessment. Students could log in from any Internet-connected computer and complete the assessment. All 107 incoming medical students were required to take the assessment within the first three weeks of classes in August 2000. Description: The reference staff of the Levy Library was asked by the medical school to develop an instruction program that would ensure that all medical students, by the time of graduation, demonstrate expertise in the core competencies and objectives outlined in the Association of American Medical Colleges’ Medical School Objectives Project. Before embarking on an ambitious instructional program to address basic computer and informatics skills, we decided to develop a Web-based assessment that would be administered to all first-year medical students at the beginning of their four-year program. It was our hypothesis that the majority of students already possessed these skills. If we are correct, our core curriculum time could be used to both refine and teach more advanced skills. By assessing the students online, we were able to quickly compile and evaluate the results and subsequently develop remedial and advanced classes. The results will be used to develop future Webbased courses and assessments in library science and medical informatics. Results/Outcome: Of 107 students, 94% completed all five sections of the assessment. Out of these, more than 90% scored 75% or above on all sections. Those who did not meet the minimum standard will be required to take a refresher course in the subject they did not pass. Evaluation Method: The structure of the assessment, questions asked, results, and evaluation will be discussed in the poster."
"Copyright permission odyssey: direct requests versus the CCC","James D. Prince, librarian; Beverly Gresehover, assistant director, Access Services; and Lolita Heimbach, reserve circulation supervisor; Health Sciences and Human Services Library, University of Maryland–Baltimore","Purpose: This poster will determine the most efficient means of obtaining copyright permissions for electronic reserves collection readings and detect any emerging trends in the relationships between publishers and the Copyright Clearance Center (CCC). Setting/Subjects: The Health Sciences and Human Services Library of the University of Maryland–Baltimore, is an academic health sciences library with an extensive electronic reserve collection. Our subjects for this poster are the Copyright Clearance Center and publishers and copyright holders that grant copyright permissions with regard to electronic reserves collections. Methodology: This is a case study, tracing the steps necessary to acquire copyright permissions for electronic reserves, comparing publisherdirect requests to CCC requests. Results: This project is in progress. The research is not completed. Discussion/Conclusion: Early data indicate that reserves units must make use of both services in order to complete copyright permissions, but that publishers grant more generous permissions and more cheaply, while the CCC is faster in turn-around and has more uniform interaction. We anticipate that our results will provide indicators that will enable us to fine-tune our process."
"Reconceptualizing the Web: designing and implementing a user-oriented consumer health information (CHI) Website","Michele Klein-Fedyshin, DM, AHIP, manager, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Shadyside, Pittsburgh, PA; Charles Wessel, manager; Jody Wozar, reference librarian; Amy Gregg, reference librarian; and Paul Worona, assistant director; Falk Library of the Health Sciences, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA","As an institution starting fresh with consumer health information (CHI), the Health Science Library System of the University of Pittsburgh had an open mind when designing a totally new CHI site. The planning team assembled a unique cross-section of information systems (IS), CHI, IAIMS, and library staff to collaborate. This group deferred the idea of a site consisting totally of lists of links. Our target audience lacked Web experience, representing an older, less affluent population. Our Website needed a structured approach that would guide inquirers, explain why a Website might be worthwhile, and offer selected, quality links. Our resulting effort is structured to promote learning about individual health or disease issues and builds progressively from dictionary definitions, through health topics, drug information, medical tests and procedures, local resources, evidence-based medicine, and physician referral sections. This structured approach allows consumers to build an understanding of a topic, which in turn can help them to formulate queries regarding the tests, treatment, and prognosis for their condition. Each section has a special feature called Keys to Information, which supplements the Internet resources listed on the site. The keys provide information tips, searching hints, detailed descriptions of Internet resources and list additional sources of information such as books and community resources. Information about regional agencies and organizations in Pittsburgh and surrounding areas, including address and phone numbers, is an important feature of the site. Many patients and families seek information to enable them to make informed health care decisions. The Evidence-Based Medicine and Decision-making section of the site links to compilations of health care guidelines, outcomes, and protocols. Some sites assess the effectiveness of health care interventions based on clinical evidence, while others offer medical protocols based on broad professional consensus. This innovative site seeks to go beyond traditional Web pages in both its format and content. It incorporates learning objectives into information presentation."
"Bridging the gap in rural health information services: Georgia’s rural health information","Rita B. Smith, RHIC librarian, Medical Library and Learning Resource Center, Mercer University, Macon, GA","Purpose: This poster will report on the creation and growth of Georgia’s Rural Health Information Clearinghouse (RHIC), an information service for health care administrators, planners, and others interested in rural health issues. Setting/Participants/Resources: The mission of the Mercer University School of Medicine is to educate physicians to meet the health care needs of Georgia’s rural and underserved areas. In support of this mission, the Rural Health Information Clearinghouse and an accompanying fulltime MLIS position were created in an attempt to provide a central information reference service to assist planners and providers in solving rural health care delivery problems. Brief Description: RHIC was collaboratively established in 1996 by the State Office of Rural Health and Primary Care, the Georgia Statewide Area Health Education Center Network, and the Mercer University Medical Library. RHIC is based at the Mercer University Medical Library, which now provides sole financial support for the project. Targeted toward Georgia health care planners and providers, RHIC provides free access to rural health resources and specialized reference services. RHIC provides database searches, current literature and news alerts, assistance in the location of funding opportunities and supporting literature, and referral to appropriate agencies and experts. While other initiatives in the state target outreach efforts toward the clinical needs of rural health care practitioners, RHIC directs its services toward hospital administrators, county commissioners, and others interested in health care administration and delivery issues common to rural areas. Results/Outcome: RHIC’s use and recognition have grown markedly since its inception. RHIC continually promotes its services through efforts such as attendance and exhibits at relevant conferences, maintenance of a Website showcasing RHIC resources and services, and a monthly email alert spotlighting rural health funding opportunities, meetings, useful Websites, and more."
"Responding to the needs of researchers with health sciences data sets resources","Peggy Tahir, information services librarian; Min-Lin Fang, information services librarian; and Jacqueline Wilson, information services librarian; Library and Center for Knowledge Management, University of California–San Francisco","Purpose: This poster will report on a project to assess researchers’ needs and uses of health sciences data sets (computer files of research data) to develop a new library service. Setting/Participants/Resources: The Library and Center for Knowledge Management at the University of California–San Francisco (UCSF) is a large academic health sciences library supporting a campus dedicated only to graduate and professional study in the health sciences. Researchers need access to data sets for their investigations, publications, teaching, and professional practice. As there is currently no coordinated program on campus to assist researchers with finding and accessing data sets, the library is evaluating the need for such a service. A team of professional staff from the reference department, data management services, information technology, and technical services is working on this project. Brief Description: The project assesses the current availability of data sets and tools in the library’s collections, on the UCSF or other UC campuses, or via state, federal, or other agencies. A survey using Web-based conferencing software (Facilitate.com) was developed to determine the needs of researchers on campus for data sets resources. Based on the survey results, we are investigating ways the library can provide services to assist clientele who need access to these resources. The team is developing Web pages that will point to key data sets resources available either via the Web or in our collections. We are also exploring other academic data services as potential models for our service. Results/Outcome: This project has provided an excellent venue for working on collaborative teams across library departments, as well as between the library and campus departments. The poster will discuss the lessons learned by this collaborative process, including campus political issues that came to light working with departments and faculty outside the library. Preliminary survey results are providing us with an understanding of current practices for obtaining and using data sets and the future needs of researchers on campus. Evaluation Method: Once we have final survey results, we will determine resources needed in order to move forward with possible implementation of a data sets service for the campus community."
"Collaboration: the key to building a quality Website","Diane Fuller, information specialist; Alexa Mayo, assistant director, Information and Instructional Services; and Patricia Hinegardner, AHIP, information specialist and Web manager; Health Sciences and Human Services Library, University of Maryland–Baltimore","Introduction: This poster will focus on the interrelationships among individuals, committees, and work groups from within the library and across campus that participated in the library Web redesign. Challenges and benefits inherent in this team approach will be discussed. Collaborative initiatives from other institutions will also be reviewed. Brief Description: The Health Sciences and Human Services Library (HS/HSL), University of Maryland, launched its original Website in 1996. In the fall of 1999, the library determined that the Website needed to be completely redesigned. The goal was to provide better organization, improve navigability, and design a more up-to-date look. The HS/HSL Web Redesign Committee directed the project in collaboration with other units on campus. To better understand the impact of collaboration on Website development, selected public, academic, and health sciences libraries were surveyed to determine who influences or participates in Website design. Results/Outcome: The challenges and successes of the HS/HSL experience and the results of the survey will be discussed."
"Don’t throw out that (dis)integrated library management system yet, use it to track your library’s activities!","Laurel Graham, media librarian; Linda J. Walton, associate director; June Carter, reference librarian; and Kurt I. Munson, head of User Services; Galter Health Sciences Library, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL","Without statistics, a library is just four walls in need of funding. Statistics prove libraries are vital components of society. Unfortunately, statistics are elusive creatures; staff forgets to check them, or random sampling tells little about the actual activities of the librarians and staff. But every year, statistics are reviewed and submitted and budgets are influenced. When our library attempted to increase the quality and quantity of our statistics, we tracked statistics in an Access database. This proved to be too time consuming, and as a result statistics were underreported. To counteract the disparity between the statistics and our actual work, we have begun collecting statistics electronically through our circulation module’s browse count utility. The library employs the Voyager integrated library management system for circulation, cataloging and acquisitions, and reporting. Implementation included installation of scanners and circulation modules at service stations without them and creation of records corresponding to each transaction by location and time of day. Statistics are collected by scanning a barcode on a plastic covered card in discharge mode. Reports are easily compiled through Impromptu, a report software add-on. Through Voyager, we could even choose to import our statistics to Access or Excel for further analysis and manipulation. The browse count utility has proved incredibly easy to implement and use for statistics collection and analysis. This system allows statistics to be kept at every service point, not done before, in a uniform manner without any manual data entry of hash marks into a database. Now reporting our activities to our funding institution, AAHSL, and ARL is a simpler process and more reflective of our busy library’s activities."
"How we view ourselves: librarians of the twenty-first century","Margaret Vugrin, AHIP, reference librarian, Health Sciences Center Library, and Hershel Womack, assistant professor, Photocommunications, School of Mass Communications, Texas Tech University–Lubbock","Our profession frequently examines stereotypes of librarians as they are presented in the non-library media (i.e., television, movies, or magazines). We are very much interested in the visual portrayal of the "librarian." Typically our professional dialog addresses the fact that we are misrepresented. One area that has not been addressed however, is how we ourselves portray the "librarian." This poster presentation will examine the visual portrayal of librarians in the photographic medium. How do we represent ourselves in our journals, in our newsletters, in our marketing literature, and in other media? Six months worth of our literature will be surveyed and reviewed. We will evaluate presentation style using basic photographic analysis. Not only will we examine the image we are presenting, but we will also evaluate and suggest what we can do to give ourselves a twenty-first century look."
"Using Web-based databases to design Web-based tutorials: the Ovid Web","Connie Schardt, AHIP, education coordinator, Medical Center Library, Duke University, Durham, NC","This poster will explain the process of designing a Web-based tutorial for searching Ovid, from conception of the idea to designing the content and templates, to distribution and sharing of the final product. The Medical Center Library wanted to provide more flexibility in training faculty, residents, and students in the basic searching features of Ovid. This primary clientele had difficulty attending the regularly scheduled Ovid training classes. We thought that developing a Web-based tutorial would give them the flexibility of learning on their own time. The tutorial would have to meet certain design requirements, such as interactivity, ease of use, fast loading screens, succinct content, and provide as much of a "real life" experience as possible. The tutorial was designed using the actual HTML screen from Ovid and incorporating links to the tutorial content to explain and simulate an actual search. Once designed and tested, we made the tutorial available to other medical center and hospital libraries by allowing them to link to our site. We began to receive inquiries from other libraries about the design process and the ability to customize the tutorial to other library needs. It was decided that the best way to share our work was to create a "generic" copy of the tutorial and let individual libraries make modifications to the tutorial for their own use."
"Creating an evidence-based medicine online tutorial: collaboration makes a championship team","Connie Schardt, AHIP, education coordinator, Medical Center Library, Duke University, Durham, NC; Jill Mayer, AHIP, assistant director, NCAHEC Library and Information Services Network; and Bob Ladd, curriculum support specialist; Health Sciences Library, University of North Carolina–Chapel Hill","Librarians from two different medical schools, Duke University and University of North Carolina, have collaborated to develop a Web-based tutorial, called Introduction to Evidence-Based Medicine. Both libraries serve health care clinicians who are eager to learn the basic process behind evidence-based medicine (EBM). Both libraries also wanted to provide a flexible opportunity for students and faculty to learn about EBM through an online environment. A statewide needs assessment conducted by the North Carolina Area Health Education Center (AHEC) Program as part of the process of developing a digital library showed that an online EBM tutorial was highly desirable. To meet these needs, during the summer of 1999 the two librarians worked with a curriculum support specialist to develop the interactive, Web-based tutorial. This poster session will present the challenges involved in creating an online learning experience and present an overview of the EBM tutorial. It will illustrate the teamwork involved in combining content strength with project coordination and design to accomplish the goal. We will specifically address development of the course objectives, planning the development process, beta-testing, developing the evaluation process, and revising the tutorial based on the evaluations. We will have a copy of the tutorial available on a laptop for review by meeting attendees."
"Modeling user’s queries for an online information retrieval system: a librarian’s experience and perspectives","Elizabeth LaRue, head, Reference, and head, Center for Academic Information Technology, Columbia University, New York","Purpose: To inform designers, of the computer-based query interface, in the "art" of the reference interview by using information drawn from experience and research. Setting/Subjects: New York Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia University Health Sciences computer scientists, medical informatics faculty, physicians, and computer science students. Methodology: Conducting a systematic literature review and literature summation, establishing query categories, formulizing MEDLINE searches, then formal classroom instruction on the reference interview and types of queries. Results: The art of the reference interview needs to be understood by all parties developing the online information retrieval system. The process a librarian uses when presented with a query, when analyzed and interpreted, can significantly aid in the design of computer interfaces that are intended to emulate an interactive query process. The librarian’s multi-step process for soliciting information replicated through a well-designed computer interface guides the user along a pathway to rich information resources. The information retrieval system works best with short answer questions. Discussion/Conclusion: Building a computerized health information retrieval system requires knowledge of the librarians’ skills in conducting reference interviews. The user interface must replicate the reference interview to find the correct information desired by the user. Knowing the types of questions asked at a medical library reference desk and what information sources are used to complete the reference interview form the main components in the computerized retrieval system."
"Improving access to consumer health information in our community: developing tools and training to support public librarians and increasing public awareness of the role of the public library and the academic health sciences library","Rachael K.

Schlimgen, head, Access Services; Arizona Health Sciences Library, University of Arizona– Tucson; Joan Biggar, managing librarian; and Karen Greaber, reference librarian; Tucson-Pima Public Library, Tucson, AZ","Consumer Health Information Links for Éveryone (CHILÉ), a consumer health information project funded by the National Library of Medicine (NLM), focuses on creating better access to authoritative health information tailored to our community’s needs by developing a partnership between the local public library and the academic health sciences library. Building on the strengths of each library, the CHILÉ project has collaboratively developed tools that support the public librarian as the first point of contact for consumers, including (1) a consumer health information Web page featuring MEDLINEplus and health issues important to our community and (2) a Web-accessible database of local organizations with health information resources open to the public. Training for public librarians in the using NLM’s MEDLINEplus and PubMed, conducting health information reference interviews, and evaluating Web-based consumer health information tools, and other topics of local interest has been developed. The partnership positions the academic health sciences library to back up the reference work of front-line public librarians by providing in-depth referral and consultation services and streamlined document delivery. There is an ongoing commitment to sharing sessions between the public and health sciences librarians and future workshops are envisioned. A key ingredient in the success of this project is the broadly based public relations campaign developed to reach consumers and health care providers. This poster will highlight the tools, training, and public relations materials developed for CHILÉ."
"MEDLIB-L and the Doctor’s Names List","Mari Stoddard, head, Education Services, Arizona Health Sciences Library, University of Arizona–Tucson; Kathy Tacke, library manager/ telecommunications coordinator, Professional Library, Memorial Hospital of Sweetwater County, Rock Springs, WY; and Jeff Middleton, support systems analyst, Arizona Health Sciences Library, University of Arizona–Tucson Z","Some people say that librarians are humorless. The Medical Libraries Discussion List (MEDLIB-L) proves that medical librarians, at least, are not. For in March 1998, more than fifty librarians participated in a month-long discussion of the odd, but appropriate, names of health care providers. It started on March 4. Dalia Kleinmuntz, AHIP, posted "CHAT: What’s in a name?" citing Dr. Polymeropoulos, a specialist in Polymorphism. Michelynn McKnight, AHIP, responded with an optometrist, Dr. Seymour Landa. A true librarian, Ellen Rothbaum, AHIP, contributed a MEDLINE search on the subject, possibly prompted Sharon Thomson’s submission of the Drs. Medline. Soon, names were flying. Some of the simpler examples were Dr. Kutteroff, surgeon; Dr. Aikenhead, allergist; and Dr. Looney, psychiatrist. Pediatricians produced the charming Dr. Sno White and the youthful Dr. Kidd. In comparison, dentists had Drs. Drewel, Nasti, Harm, and Yowl. The ubiquitous Drs. Pain, Paine, and Payne seemed to appear in every specialty. Less delicate examples included the urologists Dick Tapper, Splatt, and PP, while the OB/GYNs had Drs. Nippel, Hatcher, Hooker, and Finger. By April 1, more than 100 entries had been submitted. Gillian Goldsmith, MEDLIB-L coordinator, called a halt. Kathy Tacke collected the list of submissions, and Mari Stoddard put them on the Web. Since April 1998, the "Doctor’s (and other health care practitioners) Names List" has resided at educ.ahsl.arizona.edu/mla/doctor.htm. More than sixty newspaper articles and radio shows, and even one television segment, have featured it. Enhancements include artwork and another 200 names beyond the original 100, but its core remains the work of one mad March in MEDLIB-L."
"Using a virtual tour to integrate the physical and digital images of a library","Vickie Bady, administrative assistant; Rebecca N. Jerome, coordinator, Clinical Informatics Consult Service; Marcia Epelbaum, assistant director, Library Operations; Mary Teloh, area coordinator, Historical Collections; Frances H. Lynch, AHIP, associate director; and Nunzia B. Giuse, M.D., director; Eskind Biomedical Library,Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN","Purpose: Present a model for a balanced and complete representation of the library that accommodates all its physical and digital aspects. Brief Description: Libraries have traditionally utilized the physical library tour as a vehicle for promoting services and resources to both current and prospective users. However, the complexity of imparting a coherent and balanced view of the library, independent of presenter, remains a significant limitation of this model. With the capacity to provide objective representation of services and resources via standardized content, the virtual tour serves as a mechanism to overcome this challenge. In addition, the virtual tour allows seamless integration of the digital library, a resource that has proved more difficult to accommodate via the physical tour model. With this in mind, this academic health sciences library created a team representing all focus areas to develop a virtual tour. Existing library guides, Web pages, and other publications provided an opportunity to reuse and repackage previous efforts to create the tour’s content and design. The team created a Web template for the tour pages and used the QuickTime Virtual RealityTM software to link tour text with panoramic views of key library areas. The team has also incorporated emulation of the interactivity feature of the physical tour into the design of its virtual counterpart. The tour content, comprised of concise descriptions, is integrated via hyperlinks to the library’s Web pages for further investigation into areas of particular interest. In addition, hyperlinks to our electronic reference and information services provide the opportunity for the user to register any additional questions. Through these linkages, the tour continues to provide an in-depth orientation for users. Evaluation Method: Increased access and overall awareness of library services will be reflected via access statistics and decrease in requests for physical tours."
"Internet training and electronic document delivery to rural health care practitioners in Minnesota: summary and impact","Vicki L. Glasgow, head, BioMedical Information Service, and Dawn Littleton, AHIP, coordinator, Education Technology, Bio-Medical Library, University of Minnesota–Minneapolis","In January 2000, an outreach project funded by the Greater Midwest Region of the NN/LM was undertaken by the University of Minnesota’s Bio-Medical Library. The goal of this project was two-fold: (1) to increase rural health care practitioner’s skills in using PubMed, MEDLINEplus, and Loansome Doc and (2) to determine what impact electronic document delivery might have on Minnesota rural health professionals’ use of information. A series of workshops on PubMed, MEDLINEplus, and Loansome Doc were presented in selected areas in northeast and west central Minnesota. Sites were chosen in partnership with the Minnesota Center for Rural Health and librarians at medical centers in Duluth and Fergus Falls, MN. Hands-on, "house-call" sessions were also offered to interested health professionals, both in lieu of and in addition to more traditional workshop-format training. Changes in rural health professionals’ Internet use patterns were studied by comparing results of a survey conducted in our project with the results of a study published in 1996. In this poster presentation we will highlight outcomes of our project regarding: 1. Summary of offsite training sessions on PubMed, MEDLINEplus, and Loansome Doc to nursing, medical, and allied health staffs. 2. Technical support and hardware available for such rural training sessions. 3. Provision of customized training house calls as a follow up or in lieu of attendance at training sessions. 4. Provision of documents to the health care professionals via email or the Web. Finally, a summary of the impact of the project on health practitioners’ knowledge and usage of Internet resources will be provided."
"Integrating Websites into the library’s Web-based catalog: searchers dream come true or a cataloger’s nightmare?","Cathy C. Montoya, director, Learning Resources Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX; Karen Mast, project intern, University of North Texas–Denton; and Loan Nguyen, library specialist, Learning Resources Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX","Can the dynamic nature of the Web be cataloged like other types of media? Can cataloging Websites and creating instant links be a learning resource for students searching for fast access to credible material or is cataloging Web sites a cataloger’s nightmare? The Learning Resource Center (LRC) gateway Websites were previously organized into categories intended to be a resource to medical students involved in Integrated Problem Solving (IPS) course, a problem-based learning class. Students reported that the categories sometimes made it difficult to locate Websites of interest and Web usage statistics supported those statements. In a pilot project to determine the usefulness of including Websites as cataloged resources, the LRC embarked upon the project with 100 Websites. The goal of the project was to provide live links from the LRC’s Web-based catalog to Websites that had been cataloged in the LRC ‘s standard catalog guidelines. Because Websites can lack the credentials of a printed book or reputable software, inclusion of the Websites into the catalog must be approached with attention to the quality of the Website. Each Website needs to be evaluated based on not only the LRC’s collection development policy but also a standard that is set for Websites. The Health On The Net Foundation has a Code of Conduct that provides guidance to evaluating health and medical related Websites. It is in the best interest of the LRC to include only those Websites that have the potential of remaining updated and contain authoritative information. Potential problems areas to be explored with this project include: 1. Website evaluation process 2. collection development policy extended to Websites 3. maintaining Websites in the catalog (given the Web’s volatility) 4. degree of cataloging labor needed to sustain up-to-date live links."

The goals of this project are to streamline information gathering and dissemination in the Cancer Resource Room (CRR) that is managed by the Social Work Department. It also aims to standardize the staff’s response to frequently asked questions, thereby ensuring better quality control. To accomplish this, a project was undertaken to digitize key information resources in the CRR. A. The partnership: This section will briefly enumerate the history and description of the ongoing collaboration between Treadwell Library and the Social Work Department. B. The process 1. Interpersonal—challenges and rewards of collaborating with other disciplines (e.g., communicating and decision making) 2. Database creation—deciding between using online library catalog versus creating customized database 3. Content identification—deciding about using MGH-produced materials versus commercially produced materials 4. Content organization and indexing system—self-education on existing metadata schemes, selection and implementation of Dublin Core (DC) 5. Dublin Core—issues around using metadata (e.g., identifying DC elements and their relationships, creating metadata worksheets and data entry) 6.

"Health information for seniors: an electronic consumer health project","Jeanne Gittings, AHIP, librarian, Department of Library Services, Trinity Medical Center, Rock Island, IL","Trinity Medical Center received a Consumer Health Information subcontract from the Greater Midwest Region of the National Network of Libraries of Medicine. This grant enabled Trinity to provide Internet access to seniors through the creation of four computer labs. Three were located in retirement communities and the fourth lab, open to the general public, was created in Trinity’s Health Sciences Library. Computer classes were conducted regularly at each location. These two-hour sessions gave the seniors an opportunity to use the Internet and taught them how to locate reliable health information. A major emphasis was placed on MEDLINEplus, PubMed, and other consumer health resources. Participants evaluated the sessions and a follow-up evaluation was sent to each participant four to six weeks later. In our first six months of this eighteen-month project, over 400 seniors have participated. In addition, Trinity developed a Web page for the project: www.mytrinityqc.com. Links from this page include MEDLINEplus, material from the training classes, and other links of interest to this population. The site also provided free access to Web-based email."
"Why try L.J.I.? Issues in subject heading specificity for facilitating retrieval of Web resources at the Arizona Health Sciences Library","Fred L. Heidenreich, M.Ed., AHIP, librarian, Information Services; Mary L. Holcomb, head, Technical Services; and Gerald J. Perry, AHIP, head, Information Services, University of Arizona, Arizona Health Sciences Library, Tucson, AZ","The Arizona Health Sciences Library Website serves as a gateway to over 1,500 Web-based information resources, including free and licensed items. In addition to the list of more than 1,300 full-text electronic journals, there are databases, collections of electronic journals, digital textbooks and reference materials, and locally compiled Web resource guides. At present, most of these Web-based resources are not found in the online catalog. The library provides access by means of Web application server technology using Allarie Corporation’s Cold Fusion software in combination with a sophisticated SQL Server database. It is possible to conduct keyword searches based on words in the title of each resource. Without descriptive annotations and a system of subject headings, however, keyword searching is largely ineffective. Library staff therefore developed a single controlled vocabulary of subject headings based on the broad MeSH terms used in the List of Journals Indexed in Index Medicus (LJI). These terms are used to conduct broad subject searches of all available electronic resources. The terms are largely based on major medical specialties rather than disease terms. This approach has generally worked well, resulting in a more comprehensive retrieval for Website users. Users still have a problem finding resources when they use keywords for more precise concepts (conjunctivitis versus ophthalmology). We have achieved a modest level of success in solving this problem through the mapping of terms in see-reference style, but this solution is unsatisfactory, given the workload required to map all possible specific and broad term combinations. Another solution is the use of the library’s online catalog as the searching tool of choice where more specificity is desired. This solution works well only for electronic journals with print counterparts in the library, because these records include links to the electronic versions as well as more specific MeSH terms. Unfortunately, users are then required to search two separate systems (Website and online catalog) that offer different categories of information. This poster will highlight these problems and illustrate this library’s evolving solutions."
"Beyond the campus walls: a collaborative project with community-based family medicine preceptors and medical students","Janet A. Ohles, head, Information; Anthony Artale, information services librarian; and Diana J. Cunningham, associate dean and director; Medical Sciences Library, New York Medical College–Valhalla","Purpose: To provide clinically useful information resources for community-based family medicine preceptors and medical students rotating at these practices. Setting/Participants/Resources: A metropolitan/suburban medical school. Medical students rotating at family medicine community sites and the community physician preceptors. Handouts, Websites, and personal digital assistants addressing curriculum assignments and requests from community preceptors on specific information areas, such as alternative medicine. Brief Description: This poster demonstrates how a collaborative program evolved from one meeting in September 2000 between family medicine and library faculty, where family medicine requested assistance in locating Websites and population-based medicine for a student assignment. The meeting resulted in several areas of collaboration, including a compilation of family medicine resources for alternative medicine (databases, books, and Websites), which was developed as a paper handout for the community preceptor fall orientation. Family medicine faculty requested that this handout be available as a Website, which was done prior to the orientation. A Palm Pilot project is currently being developed; the details, results, and evaluation for the initial six months of the project will be presented in this poster. The poster will also describe how library faculty serve as an evidence-based medicine resource for the family medicine department. Results/Outcome: One information request resulted in a collaboration from which both departments have benefited. The collaboration will serve as a basis for a potential grant project for community preceptors that if funded would begin in June. Library and family medicine faculty submitted this proposal to a funding source in June 2000. Evaluation Method: A formal questionnaire was given to community preceptors to elicit information on how the specialized resources developed by library faculty have aided them in their clinical practice. Students were also given a formal questionnaire to elicit information on how the library-developed resources aided them in completing their assignments."

Wood Library; and Daniel Cleary, head, Information and Access Services, Medical Library; Weill Cornell of Cornell University, New York","Not too long ago, MEDLINE and the printed version of Current Contents revolutionized timely access to biomedical information. Sometimes a journal table of contents appeared in a printed version of Current Contents before it appeared in MEDLINE. In today’s world of electronic journals—PreMEDLINE, PubMed, and Current Contents Connect—which resource now offers the most timely information? A pilot study compared seven journals representing a variety of publication frequencies and preindexing formats over time. JAMA, New England Journal of Medicine, Circulation Research, Annals of Thoracic Surgery, Netherlands Journal of Medicine, Current Opinion in Genetics & Development, and Quarterly Reviews of Biophysics were compared on their Web pages, in PubMed, Ovid Pre-MEDLINE, and Current Contents Connect. The preliminary results showed no clear winner. In many instances, three out of four tools or all the tools had the same issue. Every health sciences library’s future should include one of these ways to access timely information for patient care and medical research."
"Getting the word out: channeling information to users through new technology and traditional resources","Cindy Gruwell, assistant librarian/coordinator, Instruction, Bio-Medical Library, University of Minnesota–Minneapolis","The changing flux of librarianship and technology has bought to the forefront the need to refocus and, in fact, rethink the processes we have traditionally used to inform our users of the various services, events, and instruction opportunities available in our library. As we move into the year 2001, we must consider how we can best address not only our users’ instruction and services needs, but also the manner in which we present and deliver these resources. To this end, technology is playing a unique and very important role by enabling us to contact and interact with many people who may not have been able to identify our services, let alone take fuller advantage of them. This session will demonstrate the role of technology and its emphasis in "Getting the Word Out". In addition, it will explore the combining of new and old methodologies that not only reach out and touch our general user population, which consists of the students, faculty, and staff of the academic health center, but also other interested parties who may not be directly affiliated with the Bio-Medical Library or the University of Minnesota itself. The poster will explore and display the role of the Internet with emphasis on Web products, email, email discussion lists, electronic university/ organization/association calendars, and some of the more traditional resources that include newsletters, postings, flyers, and brochures."
"Usability studies and surveys: ensuring quality Website redesign, the University of Maryland’s experience","Diane Fuller, information specialist; Patricia Hinegardner, AHIP, information specialist & Web manager; and Brad Gerhart, information technology support specialist; Health and Human Services Library, University of Maryland–Baltimore ","The Health Sciences and Human Services Library (HS/HSL) of the University of Maryland formed a Web redesign committee to restructure the HS/HSL Website, in the fall of 1999. The original site, developed in 1996, needed better organization, improved navigability, and a more up-todate look. A usability study was initiated to gain a better understanding of how faculty, staff, and students use the current Website. Volunteers from across the campus participated in the study. The volunteers verbalized what they were thinking as they attempted to locate eight assigned items on the Website. Two library staff members observed and recorded the volunteers’ progress. A Web-based survey was used to gather additional feedback about the site. A prototype site was developed incorporating the suggestions obtained from these evaluation mechanisms. A second usability study was initiated to evaluate the prototype site. Suggested changes were incorporated and the site was released to the public in the spring of 2000. This poster will highlight the results from the usability studies and the survey. "

"Providing culturally diverse health care information: the hospital library’s role","Lora L. Thompson, medical librarian, and Lucy Wrightington, AHIP, director, Library Services; Easton Hospital, Frank J. D’Agostino Medical Library, Easton, PA","Easton Hospital is a community teaching hospital in an area with growing diverse populations. In response to the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations’ (JCAHO) standards and Easton Hospital’s commitment to cultural diversity, the library staff responded by finding multiple ways to contribute to the effort of providing education and information on cultural diversity in health care. The library staff is involved with the Diversity Task Force, educating employees on issues of cultural diversity, providing cultural information for patient care and education, creating subject guides specific to cultural groups, and working with the local public library to share resources. This poster will focus on the different ways that hospital library staff can get involved with cultural diversity and will provide useful resources that apply to all minority groups, such as the Office of Minority Health. In addition, subject guides will be provided on four main cultural groups: African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Asian and Pacific Islander Americans, and Native Americans. Working on this type of project is a great marketing opportunity for the hospital library and has allowed us to make positive contributions toward patient care and JCAHO accreditation."

The collaboration involved the creation of a Web-based referral database, workshops to train onsite staff in the use and teaching of MEDLINEplus, training sessions for consumers, and marketing of the free services through exhibits, articles, and press releases. Setting/Participants/Resources: Information linkages were developed among The Lamar Soutter Library, a state hospital learning center, a community wellness library, the Worcester Public Library, an association-based library, a church-based free clinic, and the learning program at the new Worcester Senior Center. A laptop computer, printer, and Internet access were made available to sites that lacked suitable hardware. Some of the aspects to be illustrated by the poster include: the electronic, Web-based referral database and project homepage with links to local library resources; the educational materials developed to train staff and consumers at each site to retrieve and evaluate Internet-based consumer health information; the collaborative displays exhibited at local health fairs, statewide conferences, and community events; the challenges and lessons learned in coordinating the efforts of disparate groups; and the evaluation methodologies employed to judge success of the project."
"Consortial OPAC: a system administrator’s tale","Patricia Prior, oncall operations manager, and Martin Mutka, MBA, director, Library Consortium of Health Institutions in Buffalo, Buffalo, NY","In 1994, two library members of the Library Consortium of Health Institutions in Buffalo (LCHIB) received funding from the National Library of Medicine (NLM) for the development of an online catalog. With the success of this initial project and the evolution of the health care environment in Western New York, LCHIB wrote and submitted a "Phase Two" grant to add the other seven consortia member hospitals onto this existing OPAC. The subsequent Information Systems Grant, funded by NIH/NLM in 1998, was to add the catalogs of those libraries into the database, establish the basis for consortial purchasing and core collections in specialized libraries, and reduce redundancies and consolidate technical services. Just prior to this Phase Two implementation, the health care institutions underwent profound change including mergers and changes in administration and library leadership. The project continued, overcoming many but not all of these issues. This model explores the dynamics of adapting to discrete and sometimes conflicting missions and corporate cultures within a consortia, while finding the fit in the personnel, policies, and missions of competing institutions to shape the framework for successful multisite projects."
"Thes. Web: a digital archive of medical student scholarship","Charles J. Greenberg, M.Ed., head reference librarian, Cushing/Whitney Medical Library, Yale University, New Haven, CT","Thes. Web (thesis.med.yale.edu) is a collaborative project to create a searchable database of student thesis citations with abstracts, allowing students and faculty to rapidly locate theses by year, school, or subject, as well as conveniently read or print abstracts from a standard Web browser. Using Reference Web Poster software to put the data on the Web also allows students or faculty to download citations and abstracts into Endnote or Reference Manager. This project ideally complements the traditional emphasis on medical student scholarship at the Yale School of Medicine, which continues to have a student research thesis as a requirement for graduation. New students using Thes. Web can easily determine what has already been done in their area of interest with greater convenience and saving of time. Collaboration for this project was obtained from the Office of Student Research and a campus scientific journal that was already publishing student research abstracts. Interest in this project is also spreading to the School of Nursing and the School of Epidemiology and Public Health, which have similar thesis requirements for graduate students."

Morris, AHIP, information services librarian; Mary Beth Schell, AHEC digital library technical development project coordinator; Jean Blackwell, information services librarian; Scott Garrison, library systems operations manager; and Barrie Hayes, UNCLE digital library manager; Health Sciences Library, University of North Carolina–Chapel Hill","The major enhancements that were made to the PubMed system in the fall of 1999 prompted many medical and health sciences librarians to reexamine options for offering MEDLINE access to their patrons. With the advent of PubMed’s freely available, high-quality MEDLINE interface, previous decisions to purchase subscriptions for proprietary searching programs were open to question. In addition to cost, other issues needed to be considered. For instance, proprietary systems require some form of user authentication, such as IDs and passwords. Our institution sought to identify methods for determining the best MEDLINE system choice for our extremely diverse user group, which includes many distanceeducation students as well as off-campus students on clinical rotations. Another important factor we considered was what patrons might miss if they no longer had local MEDLINE access. Our library tackled these issues by forming a task force to evaluate the pros and cons of the different MEDLINE systems and interface options. Our group focused on analyzing the costs and benefits of continuing to offer MEDLINE through our local OVID system or switching to MEDLINE access via PubMed. We also decided to examine a third option, OVID ONLINE, primarily because of its "OpenLinks" feature for linking to the full text of journal articles. This poster will highlight the methods used for our PubMed/OVID comparative evaluation and discuss the results of our investigation."
"Variations in MeSH mapping","Kathy J. Davies, outreach coordinator, NN/LM Greater Midwest Region, Chicago, IL; Lora V. Gault, MS.Ed., assistant information services librarian and assistant professor/education coordinator, Library of the Health Sciences, University of Illinois–Chicago; and Mary Shultz, assistant health sciences librarian, Library of the Health Sciences, University of Illinois–Chicago, Urbana, IL","MEDLINE is available through a number of different interfaces. Many of these allow searchers to map to a list of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), but this mapping function varies depending on the system used. The presenters conducted a preliminary study comparing the mapping results of 112 terms between four major interfaces to MEDLINE: Internet Grateful Med, PubMed, OVID, and OCLC FirstSearch. The results of this pilot study were presented at the 1999 Annual Meeting of the Midwest Chapter, Medical Library Association. The study was then expanded to include approximately 650 terms in a wider range of subject areas and to use the newer versions of PubMed, OCLC, and OVID along with the existing Internet Grateful Med interface. The results of both studies demonstrated that each interface provides a different list of MeSH choices to the searcher. This poster will summarize the results of the larger study, providing comparisons of the mapping variations among the four interfaces. Librarians should be aware of these differences when choosing search options for MEDLINE and when training users."
"Crossing the health information divide","Javier Crespo, assistant director, UMass HealthNet, and Elaine Russo Martin, director, Library Services, Lamar Soutter Medical Library, University of Massachusetts Medical School–Worcester","For patients and health care providers alike, access to health information is available in locations traditionally removed from the health care setting. Physicians seeking background information or evidence-based approaches to clinical cases access information systems at computers in locations removed from clinical areas. Patients often seek information on health related topics after their consultations with providers. The purpose of the UMass HealthNet project is to provide access to health information resources in the immediate health care setting. To accomplish this, the project’s two objectives bring access closer to these user groups. The hardware and access objective provide computers and connectivity at affiliate health centers. Touch-screen kiosks are deployed at practice waiting rooms for patient-education access. The second objective of the project establishes a consumer health information Website designed for use at clinical practice centers. With the help of the department of Family and Community Health and the Department of Psychiatry, sites are being identified and content is being developed. Sites represent a variety of care settings where access to the Internet was previously limited. The project collaborates with clinical information services departments to assist with installations and connectivity issues. Training is offered to faculty and residents needing assistance or refresher sessions in gathering clinically relevant literature. Health care providers are able to download and print full-text articles that are available through the Internet or licensed through the library. This poster will provide an overview of the project’s objectives and milestones. The poster will also demonstrate the touch-screen interface developed for the kiosk units."
"Enhancing the online catalog with electronic journal information","Mitchel L. Walters, AHIP, manager, Cataloging, Serials, and Binding; Diane Hudson, systems librarian; Timothy C. Judkins, manager, Collections Information and Development; Helen Mayo, librarian, Research and Clinical Services; Herldine Radley, information resources specialist; and Dawn Reneau, cataloging librarian; Medical Center Library, University of Texas Southwestern–Dallas","Purpose: Electronic journals present a number of problems for our traditional understanding both of library ownership and of access through the catalog. Our decision on whether to add electronic journal information to the catalog and how much to add should, however, be guided by the needs of our clients. This study attempts to measure the usefulness to the library’s clients of information on electronic journals that was added to the online catalog. Level one enhancements include hypertext links in the catalog to journals accessible in both paper and online formats. Level two would add linked catalog records for titles accessible only in online format. Level three would add individualized holdings statements to all the electronic journal records. Methodology: A three-tiered schedule of possible electronic journal enhancements was formulated. Implementation of each successive tier will depend on measurable increases in journal searching in the catalog. • • • A random sample of catalog searches will be analyzed both to determine whether the amount of journal searching justifies the first tier of enhancements and to give a baseline from which to measure any increase in journal searches. If the first tier of enhancements is implemented, searching will again be measured. Other factors being equal, a sizable increase in journal searching should indicate that the enhancements were useful to clients and would justify implementing the next tier. Results: When we measured the amount of journal searching before any enhancements, it exceeded our expectations enough to justify the implementation of the first level of enhancements. We will measure journal searching again approximately three weeks and then six weeks after the implementation of enhancements to see if journal searching has increased. Further results will be reported at the time of the presentation. Conclusions: The study should provide evidence on whether or not the library catalog can serve as a useful tool for clients accessing an electronic journal collection. Because the study makes the implementation of each tier of catalog enhancements dependent on measurable increases in usage, it also offers a good example of evidence-based librarianship."
"Work at home: a cost-effective solution for hospital library projects","Catherine Boss, AHIP, coordinator, Library Services, Jersey Shore Medical Center, Meridian Health System, Neptune, NJ","The history of the Booker Health Sciences Library at Jersey Shore Medical Center is similar to that of other hospital libraries. For years there were two libraries, one medical library and one nursing school library with much talk of merging the two libraries into one to make library services more cost effective and to make the nursing school collection more accessible. The decision to close the school of nursing provided the catalyst for making these talks become a reality. A new facility was planned, complete with an integrated library system. Combining the card catalogs of these two collections into an electronic card catalog, however, brought up a new set of problems. The medical library collection was classified in the National Library of Medicine classification scheme, while the nursing collection was classified using the Dewey Decimal classification scheme. Both card catalogs were print catalogs and were not in machine-readable format. With the mission of the nursing collection changing from curriculum-based to one based on the clinical, research, and educational needs of the nursing community at Jersey Shore, extensive reevaluation and subsequent weeding of the nursing collection would be needed. The library staff is small (only 2 full-time people), one professional and one paraprofessional. With construction costs mounting and a tight operating budget, a cost-effective way to evaluate both collections and put them in machine-readable format had to be found. Our solution was a simple one, borrowed from the business community, work at home. The solution worked. Our poster will illustrate how we implemented a work-at-home program for our reclassification project, the myriad of benefits the solution realized, both written and unwritten, and how the tenets of our program might work for other projects."
"The librarian is in: creating a consumer health training video for public librarians","Roxanne Cox, head, Reference; Erin Bauer, electronic services librarian; and Ronnie Mevorach, reference/education librarian; McGoogan Library of Medicine, University of Nebraska Medical Center–Omaha","Medical librarians of an academic medical center library in a largely rural state reach out to public librarians to share knowledge and impart confidence in providing consumer health information. The Reference Department at the library offers public librarians a day-long workshop on consumer health services. One approach that the department thought might effectively complement this workshop was to create a video demonstrating various situations that public librarians might face. The Reference Department worked together on writing a script and finding actors; then with the aid of the medical center’s Biomedical Communications Department, filmed and edited a video, entitled The Librarian Is in: Facing Modern Consumer Health Issues in the Public Library. This poster will show the process of putting this production together from scripting, casting, filming, and editing to the finished product. The video includes five reference scenarios reflecting common questions received at public library reference desks: doctor credentials or licensing, alternative medicine, emotional patrons, cancer treatments, and drugs. Each scenario demonstrates an interaction between a librarian and a patron asking for help. Desired benefits from the video include an increase in public librarians’ skills and an awareness of how to deal with health questions."
"Healthy Women 2000: Health Information for All Ages","La Ventra Ellis-Danquah, coordinator, Community Health Information Services, and Gang (Wendy) Wu, instruction and health information services librarian; Vera P. Shiffman Medical Library, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI","This poster will outline the planning and implementation process for creating a "one-stop" health information program for college campuses. Information consumers still display interest in sharpening their skills on effectively and efficiently identifying and tracking relevant women’s health information on the Internet. Wayne State University Medical Library’s Community Health Information Services provides reference and information service to metro Detroit communities. With an increasing number of consumers requesting women’s health information via the Internet, academic librarians from Shiffman Medical Library sought the opportunity to collaborate with the College of Nursing faculty and students to design and implement a campus-wide program: "Healthy Women 2000: Health Information for All Ages". The collaborative partnership with academic librarians, local nurse practitioners, and the College of Nursing faculty, and students, added an exciting new dimension to traditional library-organized programs. The program was designed to address major concerns in women’s health as well as how to access quality health information using the Internet. The program featured: 1. a short talk delivered by the College of Nursing faculty addressing major women’s health issues from adolescence through seniors; 2. librarians’ demonstration on how to access reliable women’s health Websites including MEDLINEplus, other quality women’s health Websites, and Health Reference Center database; 3. blood pressure checks administered by nursing students; 4. hand-outs included a list of selective Internet resources on women’s health, health literature including pamphlets on women’s health conditions, women’s health organizations, clinics, programs, preventive care, and a list of local free or low-cost health care clinics; 5. a hands-on breast exam model featuring a normal and abnormal breast; and 6. Q & A. The final discussion summarized health-related issues and care with regards to age, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. The program rendered such success that the planning committee was asked to re-implement the program at the university’s new Fitness and Recreation Center for the 2001 year."
"Fingertip files: medical students use personal digital assistants for clinical information","Brenda L. Seago, AHIP, director, Computer Based Instruction Lab and Chris Stephens, applications developer, School of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealt. University–Richmond","What kind of clinical information do third-year medical students need at their fingertips to help them treat patients? Traditionally, students have carried pocket-sized guides and cards. Our medical students are provided with fourteen team teaching rooms, which contain basic textbooks and computers with access to MEDLINE and the Internet, decision support software, and various computer-based instructional materials and general software. In a large teaching hospital, it is not practical for students to return to the team room every time they require information. The student technology fee monies enabled the Computer Based Instruction Lab (CBIL) to purchase fifteen Handspring Visors to be randomly distributed to second, third, and fourth year medical students. They were enrolled in a pilot project to test palm top software for possible clinical applications. All students were notified by email of the pilot project and asked to attend an informational meeting. More than a 100 out of a possible 500 students indicated an initial interest. Additionally, many students already owned and used palm tops and were invited to the informational meeting to explain why they used the palm tops and what software they found particularly helpful. After the meeting, seventy-eight students filled out a Web-based preliminary data form and explained what they thought were the possible benefits and possible obstacles for participating in the project. They agreed to submit usage experience reports and attend at least two out of five user group meetings. Fifteen participants were randomly selected from the interested students. The Visors were distributed after each of the fifteen signed a user agreement. A meeting was held to select appropriate medical software and to demonstrate how to download free software. An informational Web page was developed for the fifteen pilot project participants as well as other user group members. Ongoing technical support for the project participants was provided by CBIL. This electronic poster will outline project specifications and present pilot project user data, including evaluations of specific personal digital assistant clinical applications for medical students."
"Innovative uses for OCLC’s CORC pathfinder technology","Dawn Littleton, AHIP, coordinator, Education Technology, and Betsy Friesen, monographs and special formats cataloger, Bio-Medical Library, University of Minnesota–Minneapolis","OCLC introduced its new Cooperative Online Resource Catalog (CORC) as a pilot project in January 1999. The project has two main components: the Resource Catalog and Pathfinder Database. The catalog and pathfinders were made available to OCLC’s cataloging members in July 2000. The Resource Catalog includes descriptive records of selected online resources, while the Pathfinder Database was intended to provide online subject bibliographies of Web-based resources. The Bio-Medical Library began creating pathfinders in CORC during the early phases of the project. Initially, we used the pathfinder technology to create only subject bibliographies. We quickly found that this technology could be easily applied to create interactive teaching and learning tools. There are numerous benefits to using CORC pathfinder technology; these include an interface with the Resource Catalog, URL checking, wide accessibility, and cooperative ventures with technical services staff. Our presentation will show: 1. The ease with which pathfinders can be created with CORC technology. 2. Interactive examples of inventive pathfinder usage. 3. How pathfinders can be tailored to a variety of audiences. 4. The benefits of using CORC pathfinders for public services staff and clientele. CORC pathfinder technology offers staff of OCLC cataloging libraries many opportunities to creatively use this technology to serve their clientele."
"Going paperless: the interlibrary loan department, Microsoft Project, and ILLiad","Susan Lieberthal, document delivery librarian, Countway Library of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA","ILLiad Management Software has been chosen by the interlibrary loan/document delivery department (ILL) at the Countway Library of Medicine, Harvard University, to automate all processes. ILLiad offers many features suitable to a large medical library. It can handle DOCLINE and OCLC requests, has a document delivery component, and has a well-developed set of reports, including copyright reporting. In order to manage the transition of this complex department to an automated, paperless operation, the document delivery librarian is using the Gantt chart tool in Microsoft Project. Plotting each process in the chart assists in clarifying policies and processes for the library as well as for the ILLiad installers and is defining the special customization needed for Countway. Microsoft Project has many features similar to other Microsoft products, making it relatively easy to use. In Microsoft Project, it is possible to enter scope, time, and resources for each task, and notes can be attached. The resources section can be used to assign people to various responsibilities. Tasks can be linked and timelines established. As the tasks of the project are itemized, some key features have emerged: On the lending side, ILLiad needs to provide customized billing features allowing the ILL staff, when updating requests, to send billing either to Electronic Fund Transfer System (EFTS) or to the new central accounts receivable system at Harvard University. On the borrowing side, Microsoft Project is helping the department to define all eligible users and how they will be authenticated through the new medical school intranet. This includes research assistants placing requests for researchers through a proxy account. Microsoft Project assists the ILL department during staff meetings. Because the program is projected from a laptop on to a screen, everyone can participate in finding gaps in the processes and in making suggestions. As automating ILL cannot be successful without heavy involvement from the systems department, these meetings include the systems staff. Microsoft Project is providing both a big picture view and the means for collecting and sorting through details. This will facilitate the successful implementation of ILLiad in the ILL department."
"As real as it gets: the use of ScreenCam, a personal computer screen recording application, to create a Web-based tutorial","Haldor Lougee-Heimer, information services librarian, Medical Sciences Library, and Afsar Mohiuddin, systems administrator, New York Medica. College–Valhalla","Purpose: This poster will describe the use of ScreenCam, a personal computer (PC) screen recording application in the creation of a Web-based tutorial. Setting/Participants/Resources: A suburban/metropolitan medical school library committed to real-time instruction. Faculty informally communicated to librarians the need to have instruction available at their desktops. Third and fourth year students are off-campus, and this tutorial provides a means to continue providing them with instruction. There is thus an ongoing effort to evaluate user needs, draw together limited resources, and utilize available technology to produce high-quality instruction. Brief Description: Web-based tutorials offer the advantage of being unrestricted by time, distance, or the need for an instructor, as well as providing both a reference source and a refresher course that is always available. While there has been a proliferation of such tutorials, they remain, for the most part, text-based, and supplemented and supported by still imagery. Purchase of SceenCam software, an inexpensive PC screen recording application, provided a unique opportunity to construct a tutorial that pilots live imagery with audio or captions: recorded real-time examples that raise the level of Web instruction. A Basic Internet Tutorial was selected for the pilot, as it is entirely situated on the computer screen. Recording what takes place in carefully selected segments (movies) and then embedding these in the tutorial for replay, provides a nearly perfect example and replication of real-time Internet activity without the presence of an instructor. Additionally, this successfully addresses the faculty’s preference of one-on-one "consults" to classroom instruction, along with addressing students rotating through sites off campus. Results/Outcome: A Web-based tutorial about the Internet that provides a significant portion of its instruction with recordings (movies) of realtime activity. Evaluation Method: User satisfaction is being evaluated by means of a gate counter, email response, a one-time test group, and an online evaluation form. Faculty and students are surveyed to determine which information resource will be the next course developed using this Webbased teaching approach."
"Introducing access to electronic health information for the public: Webster Parish libraries meet NLM","Dennis Pernotto, Ph.D., head, IAIMS; James Pat Craig, director; Rosa Chilton, head, User Education and Outreach Services; Dixie Alford Jones, AHIP, head, Reference Section; Michael Watson, M.D., assistant director, Systems; Medical Library, Lousiana State University Health Sciences Center–Shreveport; and Eddie Hammontree, director, Webster Parish Library System, Minden, LA","Purpose: To extend electronic health information services to rural Webster Parish by sharing information resources of NLM with health care providers and consumers in heavily concentrated minority populations through the use of advanced technological applications. Settings/Participants/Resources: A collaborative effort between the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center–Shreveport Medical Library and the Webster Parish Library focuses on the development of a Website, which is easily accessible to consumers and to health care personnel. Brief Description: This project specifically demonstrates assistance to the marginally literate in rural parishes of the lower Mississippi delta project of the NN/LM program of NLM and to those in underserved areas of Northwestern Louisiana. Major features include: (1) training public librarians to use NLM databases, (2) developing a working model in one rural parish that can readily be transferable to all of the rural parishes of Northwestern Louisiana, (3) testing the practicability of the proposed model, (4) evaluating the effectiveness and impact of the model, and (5) exporting the results of the study on a local, regional, statewide, and national basis. Results/Outcome: The project demonstrates how any health sciences center (HSC) library can more effectively extend access to consumers and health care personnel. It also furthers the integrated approach to information management advocated by the Matheson-Cooper Report. Finally, it provides a model for the broader distribution of future electronic health information. Evaluation Method: Evaluation was gathered through forms completed by the public librarians who received training, through forms completed by consumers at the public libraries, and by recording the numbers of hits on the Website. Project supported in part by NLM Grant # N01-LM-6-3525. "
"The Utah Consumer Health Information Network (uchin.med.utah.edu)","Elizabeth Workman, University of Hawaii, 1993, affiliate librarian, Eccles Health Sciences Library, University of Utah–Salt Lake City","In May 2000, the Eccles Health Sciences Library, in collaboration with the Health Round Table of the Utah Library Association, launched the Utah Consumer Health Information Network (UCHIN). UCHIN is a consumer health information resource that simultaneously serves and combines the services of libraries and health care providers throughout Utah. The project’s primary goal is to reach consumers at the point of need, whether in a hospital, at home, or at the library. In order to fulfil this goal, a librarian and round table member created a Website that provides utilities for consumers, providers, and librarians. For consumers, there is an extensive list of evaluated Websites, plus contact information and links for community libraries throughout the state. For health care providers, the UCHIN Website provides access to evaluated patient education handouts and professional resources (state medical association, state health department, PubMed, and other NLM services, etc.). Librarians can find collection management materials (core lists and other bibliographies, deselection guidelines, etc.) instructional aids, and access to Internet evaluation criteria. The expected results of the UCHIN project include improved information services for consumers, higher visibility for library services, increased access to useful materials for physicians, and assistance for librarians in collection development, patron instruction, and professional development in the field of consumer health reference. The primary anticipated outcome is better communications and a sense of teamwork among those who serve health consumers in Utah."
"Emerging handheld technologies in the medical field","Annamae Trypus, graduate assistant, Library, All Children’s Hospital, St. Petersburg, FL","The use of handheld computers or personal digital assistants (PDAs) by doctors and other medical staff has increased dramatically in recent years. PDAs help free doctors from stationary desktop computers allowing them to access information from anywhere. Doctors can retrieve and update medical records as they move from patient to patient, lowering the risk of medical errors caused by incomplete records, illegible handwriting, or the doctor’s inability to recall patient details long after they have spoken with the patient. Doctors can use the PDA to answer several questions on a decision tree to determine a patient’s risk level at the patient’s bedside. Doctors may also use their PDAs to access online databases and full-text books such as Physician’s Desk Reference. Because the librarian is a key portal to new ways of finding and utilizing information, the medical staff will naturally turn to the medical librarian for assistance with handheld information. It is vital that the librarian be aware of this technology, how to use it, and how best to address the needs of doctors regarding PDAs."
"From the ground up: development of a Web-based online tour and orientation","Jeanne Larsen, assistant director, Information Services, and Taeyeol Park, curriculum support specialist, Dahlgren Memorial Library, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC","Purpose: This poster will chronicle the development of the Dahlgren Library’s online tour and orientation. Our primary goal in developing the online tour and orientation was to provide an easily accessible resource that could be used with orientation sessions and is available to patrons around-the-clock. Future features of the online tour and orientation include value-added components such as library skills evaluations that will be linked to the tour site. Setting/Participants/Resources: Georgetown University’s Dahlgren Memorial Library is a multi-level collection housing over 186,000 books, 1,000 journals, 400 electronic resources, and 3,500 multimedia and software resources. The library serves more than 5,000 students, physicians, and allied health personnel. The beginning of each academic year sees an influx of 500 new students, few of whom are familiar with the layout of the library or location of various resources within it. Brief Description: In February 2000, under considerable time, staff, and resource constraints, the Education Team at Dahlgren Memorial Library initiated discussion about developing an online tour and orientation to be utilized during Fiscal Year 2001 orientation sessions. Creating an effective online tour and orientation meant drawing on the talents, resources, and unique perspectives of a diverse group of library personnel. This poster will describe the process from inception to completion, including how the resource was utilized during orientation sessions, and possible future applications for this resource. Results/Outcome: The finished product, which is located at www.dml.georgetown.edu/library/tour-orient.html, was a carefully planned and executed effort, which produced an online resource that saves time and paper costs. Our online tour and orientation can serve as a template for other academic libraries seeking to stem the rising costs of paper handouts. It also serves as a ready reference source for library patrons any time of day or night, often alleviating the need for personal assistance. Evaluation Method: We solicit feedback from patrons via a "comments" link and will continue to monitor our patrons’ responses."
"Going solo on OT SEARCH: a bibliographic database in occupational therapy","Maria Tsitseras Sylvain, reference librarian, American Occupational Therapy Foundation, Bethesda, MD","Technology constantly challenges librarians to provide current training for online databases for its users. The rapidly increasing pace of technological advancements can leave librarians communicating via email or telephone with frustrated patrons at a remote site. Online tutorials are effective training materials that are ideal for delivering informative, unsupervised training for both individuals and large audiences at any remote location. The recent upgrade to OT SEARCH has spurred an urgent need for online user training at the Wilma L. West Library. As a result, the library has created online tutorials on how to search OT SEARCH in an effort to increase communication with its users and to empower them to search and retrieve information. The online tutorials are supplemented by a series of printed tutorials that are published in OT Practice, a popular periodical among occupational therapists and occupational therapy students. OT SEARCH is a bibliographic database covering the literature of occupational therapy and related subject areas, such as rehabilitation, education, psychiatry or psychology, and health care delivery or administration."
"Introducing a Web-Based consumer health information database?","Caryn Scoville, public services librarian, and Ann Thering, graduate library assistant, J. Otto Lottes Health Sciences Library, University of Missouri–Columbia","Purpose: This report describes the collaborative development of a new Website to serve as a portal for consumers seeking health information, with a special focus on resources available in the state of Missouri. In conjunction with the Patient Education Department of University of Missouri Health Care, the Information Services Department of the J. Otto Lottes Health Sciences Library has developed a patient-education Website to provide patient education and consumer health information for the general public, as well patients and physicians at University of Missouri (MU) Health Care. Brief Description: The Website will be dynamically linked to an Oracle database. Content will include all patient-education materials produced at University of Missouri Health Care, links and descriptions of online support groups and Missouri support groups that meet in person; MICROMEDEX CareNotes; over 700 health questions and answers generated through an online question-and-answer service; and other Missouri health resources. All records will be searchable by broad and more specific subject categories, title, and keyword, and are being indexed using the National Library of Medicine’s MEDLINEplus’s subject headings. Additional keywords are also being assigned to enhance searchability. Results/Evaluation: User-testing of the site will ensure a friendly interface and help eliminate problems. Staff at MU’s Health Information Center, located in a local shopping mall and staffed by registered nurses, will be trained in the use of the site and its content to enhance their ability to provide health information to the public. In addition, training in the use of the site will be offered to public librarians in Missouri and to the public in Columbia, Missouri."
"Train-the-trainer (TNT): gateways to quality health information","Diana Robertson, library services co-ordinator; Margaret (Peg) Allen, AHIP, library consultant; Suzanne Matthew, Ph.D., executive director; and Colleen Crowley, outreach librarian; Northern Wisconsin Area Health Education Center–Wausau","The train-the-trainer concept is being used today in everything from fire safety to adult education instruction. The extrapolation into the library information field was only natural. One of the main goals of the third and fourth year of a four-year National Library of Medicine grant awarded to Northern Wisconsin Area Health Education Center (NAHEC) is to facilitate consumer access to health-related information resources. Train-the-trainer fit with this goal by using already established relationships to increase consumer awareness. The health care providers and public health departments in the geographic areas were the original partners. They were invited to bring their community public and school librarians. The train-the-trainer workshops consisted of basic training tips, PowerPoint presentations available to them on disk and downloadable from the Web, a workbook, and a preparation checklist. Computers were funded and distributed to partners to be placed in public areas and were set up with the consumer health information Web page of NAHEC as the home page of their browsers. There were three types of workshops and one demonstration presentation. The demonstration presentation was meant for an audience who could then attend the workshops and encourage others to participate. The intended audiences included interested parties in hospital auxiliaries, senior center clubs, and community clubs, such as Rotary. The workshop participants came out of these demonstration presentations. The three types of workshops include an introduction to the Windows operating system "Introduction to Windows and the Internet," an introduction to email "Conversations On-line: E-mail basics," and searching the Internet "Searching the Internet for Quality Health Information." The availability of all these tools will enable communities to better train each other on how to find quality health information on the Internet. Posters will include training materials and forms used for evaluation."
"An odyssey through gray literature access by the establishment of a Web searchable state morbidity database","Kathryn E. Kerdolff, AHIP, reference librarian, Health Sciences Center Library, Louisiana State University–New Orleans","The purpose of this electronic poster is to demonstrate the establishment of the Web-searchable State Morbidity Database (melvil.lsuhsc.edu/ ris/risweb.isa), a database of cataloged, linked, and indexed state health publications. State publications are considered "gray literature," because they are not indexed by any of the published indexing sources and have limited distribution. They do however provide current, detailed, local health information. The database provides Internet access to the publications by linking to the full-text copy or locating a copy from a library catalog. During the electronic poster demonstration, publications will be identified and located using the Internet site created for this purpose. Showing the actual cataloging and indexing procedures for an example publication will also demonstrate bibliographic management of these publications in a Web-searchable database. This project started as a necessity for our librarians to quickly locate local disease incidence and prevalence reports. We cataloged and indexed our state publication, the Louisiana Morbidity Report (LMR) and made it accessible in a searchable bibliographic database via the Web. While some states have indexed these publications, we recognized that other states’ equivalent publications had similar access problems. Locating the specific publications is less straightforward when the reports are not cataloged or indexed. The State Morbidity Database, modeled from the LMR, was started to provide easier access to these morbidity publications from other states. Currently, we have identified and have links to morbidity publications for each of the fifty states. This demonstration will be of interest to anyone who manages gray literature, small ready reference collections of items that are high use but difficult to locate because of lack of indexing. Our newspaper clipping file and faculty publications files were created and are managed following this same format."

To provide the best possible information service, a committee from the library’s Information Services Department developed a proposal to allocate space for a consumer health collection to serve UMC patients and families and members of the general public. This process included an informal email discussion list–based survey of academic medical libraries, consultations with the UMC Patient and Family Education Council, and analysis of local experience. After study and discussion, the committee made recommendations for the location and space requirements for a separate consumer health collection. The committee recommended that the library catalog all consumer health materials in the standard NLM classification but house them apart from the reference collection. Call numbers, special labeling, tape, and signage were suggested to identify the collection materials and location. Because the university medical center serves a diverse clientele, the library wrote information brochures in different languages to assist consumers in their quest for health information. "Prescription for Information Therapy" forms were created for health professionals to promote the referral of patients and their families to Information Services/Reference staff. The forms specify diagnosed conditions and the health information needs of the referred individuals and assist the reference librarians to identify materials that best meet those needs."
"Information services outreach to health professionals serving Hispanics in the Northwest Ohio Region","Marlene Porter, head, Information Services, R.H. Mulford Library, Medical College of Ohio–Toledo","According to government reports, Hispanics are an underserved population when it comes to medical care. With statistics showing that Northwest Ohio has a fairly large Hispanic community, an information outreach subcontract was granted to the Mulford Library of the Medical College of Ohio-Toledo through the National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NNLM/Greater Midwest Region–NO1-LM-6-2523). This project created a relationship between the Mulford Library and health care professionals who care for Hispanics in five northwest Ohioclinics (3 in Toledo, 1 in Fremont, and 1 in Willard). Internet connections for accessing MEDLINE, Loansome Doc, and other library and Internet resources were established. Resource training was conducted by the regional library to familiarize the health care professionals in these systems with emphasis placed on utilizing electronic resources in serving Hispanic patients. This poster documents the project from inception to evaluation."

Fifteen GHSLA members served on the committee: eight academic librarians from all four of Georgia’s medical schools (Emory University School of Medicine, Medical College of Georgia, Mercer University School of Medicine, Morehouse School of Medicine), four hospital librarians and three Area Health Education Center (AHEC) outreach librarians. They were assisted by colleagues at the National Network of Libraries of Medicine, Southeastern/Atlantic Region, Baltimore, MD; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA; and the Nicholas Davies Community Health Library, Atlanta, GA. Committee members are listed as chapter authors and GHSLA received $10 per published page. The project provided a unique opportunity for the librarians to use their expertise in locating quality information resources and be recognized as part of the health care team."
"Building on the foundation of "Mastering Medical Information": reinforcing information retrieval skills at the University of Rochester","Julia Sollenberger, AHIP, director and assistant professor, Medical Informatics, and Kathryn W. Nesbit, AHIP, coordinator, Education Services, Edward G. Miner Library, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY","For true mastery of information retrieval skills, students must receive frequent reinforcement of the basics introduced to first-year medical students at the University of Rochester (UR) during the course "Mastering Medical Information (MMI): Foundations for a Lifetime of Learning." The problem-based learning (PBL) environment of the school’s new Double Helix Curriculum requires that students begin their undergraduate medical education with a strong foundation in searching for and evaluating information and then applying that information to a clinical case. Basic MEDLINE searching skills are covered in hands-on computer labs in the MMI course during the first four weeks of the curriculum, with a required homework assignment and a graded exam. Basic skills are not sufficient, however, in this information-intensive world; librarians and faculty at the UR are working together to provide experiences that support continued skill-building and enhanced knowledge of resources in evidence-based medicine. Later in their first year, students receive two more "interventions." First, they are given advanced searching instruction as part of an evidence-based medicine lecture in their eighteen-month Ambulatory Clerkship Experience (ACE), followed by an assignment. Students develop a clinical question from an actual patient encounter, search that question on MEDLINE, find a research article on the topic, and then evaluate the article using evidence-based medicine criteria. Students receive individual feedback on their clinical questions, and then, after performing a MEDLINE search, meet with a librarian for forty-five minutes to discuss search strategy and to reinforce techniques for searching for evidence-based medicine resources used in clinical decision-making. In the spring of Year 1, all students receive a standardized MEDLINE search question as an assignment in their Host/Defense course. Librarians evaluate each search by comparing it to a "gold standard" search strategy, and students receive written feedback. By having repeated interactions with library staff, the students are able to enhance their information retrieval skills. An individual student’s progress can be tracked from one assignment to the next and assistance offered where appropriate. Students’ information retrieval skills will be formally assessed as part of the comprehensive exams administered at the end of their second year. A single-sheet PowerPoint poster will be prepared utilizing rich color and graphics to illustrate content. An illustration of a DNA double helix will form the basis of the design."
"Imaging: what we learned when scanning text for data entry in an osteopathic literature index database","Lynn F. Johnson, CAS, special projects librarian; Ann Brooks, MBA, AHIP, associate director, Public Services; B. Carter, special projects librarian; Craig S. Elam, AHIP, associate director, Technical Services; and Dohn Martin, associate director, Medical Informatics; Gibson D. Lewis Health Sciences Library, University of North Texas Health Science Center–Fort Worth","A current trend in the information industry is digital imaging. The Gibson D. Lewis Health Sciences Library at the University of North Texas Health Science Center–Fort Worth (UNTHSC–FW) is using optical character recognition (OCR) technology for data entry of selected journal abstracts into an Osteopathic Literature Index Database. Because scanning was an add-on to the original project, adaptations were made that created both opportunities and challenges. Valuable insights have been gleaned from using this technique for data entry, including issues of software compatibility, post-scanning processing, staffing, and training. Conclusions for efficiency and effectiveness will be suggested. Solutions, change of procedures, and "how we would do it if we could do it all over again" will be addressed. The original project began in 1997, when the UNTHSC–FW and the Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine (KCOM) libraries were awarded a five-year $385,000 contract to develop the world’s first comprehensive index to the international osteopathic literature. The Osteopathic Literature Index Database is being sponsored by the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) and the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM)."
"Library use survey of University of Texas Health Science Center–San Antonio faculty: comparison of 1996 and 2000","Jonquil D. Feldman, assistant to the library director, and Virginia M. Bowden, Ph.D., AHIP, Library director, Briscoe Library, University of Texas Health Science Center–San Antonio","In the spring of 2000, the library of the University of Texas Health Science Center–San Antonio (UTHSCSA) conducted a survey of a random sample of UTHSCSA faculty on their library use and perceptions of the collection and services. Questions were based on the faculty survey that had been conducted in 1996, with minor changes to account for resources that were not previously available. The survey measured how important the library resources and services are to professional productivity. Specific questions measured perceptions about the library’s electronic information resources, including full-text journals and databases and frequency of printing versus reading the documents on the screen. Open-ended questions elicited opinions on fee increases and prioritizing in times of limited funding. Responses were compared with the 1996 survey, with gratifying results showing that respondents in 2000 reported using library resources more, and the importance of resources and services had not changed significantly. This poster will show the survey and evaluation results."
"Merging the library with the medical curriculum: a Web-based approach","Jacqueline Scolari, Ph.D., director, Medical Resource Center, and Sarah Merideth, curriculum coordinator, School of Medicine, Southern Illinoi. University–Carbondale","The school of medicine recognizes the importance of the library in delivery of the curriculum. To this end, the library strives to provide meaningful information resources and educational tools for students and faculty in the first-year medical curriculum. The school of medicine curriculum is problem based and emphasizes the importance of self-directed learning. Students work in small groups with a faculty facilitator to develop learning issues for research and further study. This research directly involves exploration of print and electronic resources. The purpose of this project was to create a Web-based resource that provides information essential to successful progress through the first-year medical curriculum. Components of the Website: Library—General Information, Library hours, Holiday schedule, Circulation periods, Special services (including renewing or requesting material) Curriculum: Annual calendar, Weekly unit calendars, Resource faculty lists and links, Group lists, Learning issues, Clinical experience schedules, Other curriculum documents Research and library links: Campus libraries, Research sources (including links to the library vertical file, medical databases, online journals, and curriculum related Websites) News and events: Exhibits, New library resources Written student and faculty, surveys are used to provide feedback about the Website. Respondents are asked to evaluate the site, as well as recommend additional resources for the library’s collection. On the survey, respondents also are asked to provide suggestions for additional links and other improvements. Surveys are collected and compiled at the end of each curriculum unit. Consideration is also given to these responses when editing and updating the library and curriculum Website. In addition, data is collected as part of a longitudinal research project."
"A shared Web catalog: come hell or high water","Patrice Hall, librarian, Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, PA; and Valerie A. Gross, librarian, Geisinger Health System, Danville, PA","Consumer health libraries are new to Central Pennsylvania. Many people are not aware of the relative ease with which they can access userfriendly, consumer-oriented materials or of the positive impact these materials can have on health outcomes. In March 1999, the Community Health Information Library and the Women’s Resource Center, two consumer health libraries in the Penn State Geisinger Health System, submitted a LSTA grant application to the Commonwealth Libraries of Pennsylvania. The goals of the grant were twofold. The first was to make the resources of the libraries more visible and accessible by combining and automating the holdings of each library into a Web-based catalog. The second was to create an electronic version of the patient education brochures published by the health system and to make them available as part of the new automated catalog. Not unlike Odysseus, the two librarians faced many unexpected problems as they tried to achieve their goals. This poster session will describe their journey through the use of flowcharts and a timeline. It will also include a discussion of the lessons learned as they guided their project through the demerger process of their institution. A demonstration of the successfully implemented catalog will be presented."
"Consumer health information education initiative","Jeanne B. Sadlik, coordinator, Information Management Education; Mary Klatt, head, Research & Access Services; and Logan Ludwig, Ph.D., AHIP, associate dean, Loyola Health Sciences Library & Telemedicine; Health Sciences Library, Loyola University, Maywood, IL","With the proliferation of Internet access, the availability of consumer health information has grown to astronomical levels. As availability of this information increases, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find reliable and authoritative health information on the Web. Health sciences librarians are expanding their roles as providers and quality filterers of this information by helping professionals and consumers find and evaluate consumer health information on the Web. With the help of an NLM grant, the Health Sciences Library of Loyola University of Chicago is developing a consumer health information program. This program focuses on training public librarians and health professionals in the use of such Internet tools as PubMed and MEDLINEplus. These professionals will in turn educate their local publics. The program targets six communities in Illinois. Two seminars will be offered to health professionals and public librarians. Seminars will be presented through face-toface contact for the three northern Illinois communities and through videoconferencing to the southern Illinois communities using the Illinois Rural Telehealth Alliance network. One seminar will focus on using PubMed. The other will focus on MEDLINEplus and locating and evaluating authoritative consumer health Websites. To support these seminars, the library has developed a consumer health Website, guides, handouts, and Web-based PowerPoint tutorials. Evaluations and feedback will follow each seminar. The seminars will take place between June 2000 and July 2001. In our poster, we will report on the design and development of this program and progress to date."
"Competencies for liaison work for health sciences librarians","William Olmstadt, client services librarian, Medical Sciences Library, Texas A&M University–College Station","Entry-level job descriptions for health sciences librarians frequently offer the new librarian the chance to serve as a liaison to a department, school, or outside agency, depending on the contacts the library has established. Such contacts are essential for providing quality service and assessing user needs. Yet often, these duties are given to new professionals who have no experience as liaisons. A five-part model of competencies for effective liaison work is proposed, including relevant interpersonal factors, in addition to specific kinds of knowledge about the library and the liaison clients. The model also identifies relevant political and environmental factors of which the liaison should be aware. These factors are tied to real examples from over a year of successful liaison work to a school of public health. The model can serve as a useful guide for many audiences, such as the new librarian in a liaison role, the experienced librarian in a new role as a liaison, and library managers preparing to hire. Additionally, for those librarians wishing to implement a formal liaison program, the model can serve as a basis for discussion."
"The Basic Health Sciences Library Network (BHSL): a grassroots interlibrary loan network-fifteen years of success","Patricia Baldwin Regenberg, AHIP, manager, Health Sciences Library, Mountainside Hospital, Montclair, NJ; Marilyn L. Daniels, manager, Health Sciences Library, Latrobe Area Hospital, Latrobe, PA; Lydia Friedman, AHIP, director, Medical Library Services, Degenshein Memorial Library, Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY; and Caryl Kazen, chief, Library Service, Veterans Health Administration, Office of Information/Enterprise Strategy, Washington, DC","The Basic Health Sciences Library Network (BHSL), a free reciprocal, multi-state network, began operation in May 1986, with 132 charter members from four consortia in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. It currently boasts more than 430 members from 27 consortia in all nine states in NN/LM Region 1 and Region 8. The members exchanged more than 350,000 free loans in 1999. Because transactions are done on a free reciprocal basis, the dollar savings to member institutions are considerable. The network’s organizational framework has been key to its success. Libraries are placed in one of eight levels based primarily on their interlibrary loan volume. Participants are asked to route each interlibrary loan request to the library that falls in the lowest level of the hierarchy for that given title, and routing tables are set up accordingly. Each participating consortium appoints a network coordinator who performs a number of important functions. Using statistics submitted monthly by their members, the coordinators monitor interlibrary loan patterns of their local group to ensure no library becomes overburdened. In addition, they provide input into the ongoing structure, focus, and activities of the larger network. As BHSL begins its fifteenth year of operation, it faces many challenges as well as many opportunities. In the year 2000, new membership standards were set in place. Included is a requirement that a librarian with a master’s degree in library or information science manage each library. Another recent change has involved the network’s union list, an essential piece in BHSL’s smooth operation. From its inception, BHSL used the Union Catalogue of Medical Periodicals (UCMP), produced by the Medical Library Center of New York, to supply this vital service. New DOCLINE with its SERHOLD component means members will no longer have to pay to have their holdings managed. Finally, the advent of new DOCLINE opens up the possibility of interlibrary loan sharing across networks and NN/LM regions. The vision of the founders of BHSL has been more than realized and the opportunities for future growth are only beginning to be explored."
"Reaching across the border: outreach to Spanish-speaking health care providers using a bilingual Website of information resources","Mary L. Riordan, AHIP, associate librarian, Information Services, and Jose Solorzano, support systems analyst, Arizona Health Sciences Library, The University of Arizona–Tucson","Arizona’s sole major medical resource library is the University of Arizona Health Sciences Library (AHSL) in Tucson. Established in the late 1960s to support teaching, research, and medical practice, today the AHSL serves the Colleges of Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, and Public Health; the School of Health Professions; University Medical Center; and, as a public tax-supported institution, Arizona health care providers and the general public. Due to Tucson’s proximity to the United States-Mexico border, the AHSL has long sought an optimal means of extending our resources and services to Spanish-speaking health care providers and students from the Mexican state of Sonora. Recent developments in information technology provided the solution—creation of a bilingual Website of health information resources. Users may search MEDLINE for recent journal articles, determine if they are available at the AHSL by checking ALOE, our online catalog, and order either photocopies or electronic transmission of the information. They may also consult resources from health-related organizations, a multilingual medical dictionary, statistical resources, and resources providing bilingual consumer health and patient-education materials. This poster describes the development of the Website and outlines some of its major features."
"Library staff technology training: a two-tiered model","Colleen Cuddy, systems librarian; Joan Dalrymple, access services librarian; and Trisha Stevenson Medeiros; Ehrman Medical Library, New York University School of Medicine–New York","Through a review of current library literature as well as casual conversation with our own library staff, a need was identified to establish a continuum of staff training in computer technology and information services. The educational needs of the library staff were assessed via observation, interviews, logging incoming questions at public service areas, and reviewing helpline and information desk emails. Data gathered during the assessment assisted in the development and design of the staff training program and will provide a form of project evaluation. Based on the gathered data, a two-tiered staff training program was developed. The first phase addresses core computer competencies that are required by all library staff. Developed courses address the operating system, basic hardware, troubleshooting, and a variety of Internet and productivity software. Phase II is designed specifically for public services staff and staff who rotate at the information desk, but all interested staff are welcome to participate. It includes an introduction to the library, reference and searching strategies, and customer relations basics. The poster will graphically represent the project design and the ongoing process of staff training."
"Exploring new frontiers: collaborative relationships between medical libraries and bookstores","Deborah A. Ruck, information resources librarian, Libraries, Medical College of Wisconsin–Milwaukee; and James Girouard, bookstore manager, Matthews MCW Bookstore, Milwaukee, WI","Libraries and bookstores are often seen as competitors, but on our campus the library and bookstore are collaborators. Since 1998, the information resources librarian and the bookstore manager have been successfully experimenting with collaborative projects. One of the most notable endeavors has been the annual Board Prep Night. This is a unique event where the student body and staff from the bookstore, library, and academic affairs come together to share insight, study strategy, and experience, as well as hindsight, with second-year medical students preparing for the USMLE Step 1 Exam. To promote the event, we created a joint display of USMLE Step 1 Exam review products. The library provided prominent display space and bibliographic information, including call numbers, so that customers could find books quickly in either the bookstore or the library. The bookstore provided books, so that library copies remained available for use, and props such as stethoscopes, brass bookends, and medical bags. The library and bookstore also produced handout materials such as a joint bookmark listing top-rated and high-use review books, and a joint flyer featuring computer products available for use in the library or for sale in the bookstore. The bookstore manager and staff from the library were on hand at the event to share information on student preferences and answer questions about resources. Through collaboration, the library and bookstore are now able to provide customers with a greater variety of resources. In addition, customers have more options for access to these resources. The results have provided increased knowledge of products and publishing industry trends for both staff and customers. Other ideas for collaboration could include working with student groups and coordinators of continuing medical education seminars or national health observances such as "American Heart Month" in February. Let your imagination take you to "unknown planets" on your campus, and let your customers reap the benefits of your collaborative explorations!"
"Using empirical data to develop a consumer health Web-based information resource","Jeffrey Huber, Ph.D., associate professor, and Mary Snyder, Ph.D., assistant professor, Texas Woman’s University–Denton","The School of Library and Information Studies, Texas Woman’s University (TWU), is collaborating with the Dallas Public Library System (DPL) to facilitate access to consumer health information (CHI) in the Dallas Metroplex area. TWU project staff are providing training to DPL staff members regarding the use of electronic CHI resources. Training sessions are available to all DPL staff members at the Central Library location, twenty-two branches, and the library’s bookmobile. The Dallas Public Library System employs some 500 individuals. As part of this initiative, a Web-based information resource is being developed to facilitate training. The Web-based resource serves as the structured curriculum for demonstration and training sessions. Each session includes an evaluation component whereby DPL staff are provided the opportunity to give feedback regarding training and the utility of the Web-based resource. Feedback is incorporated into training sessions and used to refine the Web-based information resource. Ultimately, the Web-based resource will be turned over to DPL for staff to conduct demonstration and training sessions for their patrons. At the same time staff training sessions are being held, DPL patrons are being surveyed to determine prominent health information needs in the community as well as which, if any, electronic CHI resources are currently being used. Information gathered from the surveys is being incorporated into the Web-based resource. Following this model, the resulting Web-based resource will reflect the health information needs of the community, and Dallas Public Library staff will be adequately trained in using electronic CHI resources to locate relevant patron information. This poster will provide a general overview of the project but will include a special focus on using empirical data in developing the consumer health Web-based information resource."
"How did you find that? The odyssey of NOAH’s online genetics information for patients","Gail-Yvette Hendler, AHIP, information services librarian, Medical Library, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY; Kristine M. Alpi, AHIP, information services librarian, Samuel J. Wood Library, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY; and Patricia E. Gallagher, AHIP, information specialist, Library, New York Academy of Medicine–New York","The definitive mapping of the human genome and recent advances in medical genetics have produced previously unimagined possibilities for twenty-first century medicine. Witnessing the explosive growth of molecular biology research reveals an increased understanding of the cause and treatment of human disease. Discoveries in cancer, on the molecular level, have led to widespread and expanding implications for screening, prevention, and treatment strategies. Practical applications of this new scientific data are rapidly translating into reality. What will the new medical genetics information odyssey mean to consumers? Patients read daily headlines (online and in print) that proclaim miraculous gains made from basic and clinical findings. The rapid pace of twenty-first century medical breakthroughs will result in an increased demand for the facts, the limitations, and the fundamentals behind the headlines. Consumers will need trustworthy information resources to support and inform medical decisions they will face about prenatal testing, genetic testing, and genetic counseling and, someday soon, gene therapy. Consequently, twenty-first century medical librarians must be prepared to meet the information needs of today’s and tomorrow’s health care consumers. New York Online Access to Health (NOAH), an online, reference library in English and in Spanish has launched guides to reliable, authoritative, and current information resources about cancer genetics and genetic diseases. NOAH’s mission is to provide timely and unbiased health information to the general public. NOAH arranges information around the key issues patients ask and provides full-text answers to: what are genes, what are cancer genes, what is gene therapy, what is genetic counseling, and what are specific genetic diseases and information resources. Page editors are volunteer medical librarians who quality filter the best on the Web to improve the public’s health. Doctors, nurses, and librarians have benefited from the easy access to hard to find information. Future plans include linking to multimedia (streaming) presentations by genetics specialists."
"Patron access to electronic journals and books in the hospital library","Deborah L. Adams, AHIP, director, Library and Internet Services, Library and Media Services, Botsford General Hospital, Farmington Hills, MI","In 1998, our hospital library jumped into the electronic journal arena. Given the fact that we had electronic journals through more than one vendor and maintained some print journals, it soon became clear that we needed an easier way for our library patrons to find these journals. We created an Excel spreadsheet to start and then added URL links in our new online catalog in spring 1999. We also created a journal list on our intranet that provides links from each journal title to the appropriate database where it is housed. In 1999, we added some electronic books through one of our database vendors; these were also added to our online catalog. The next steps will be to provide links directly to each journal within the databases available on the Internet. We now have more than 214 electronic journals, 120 print journals, and 38 electronic books. Usage studies and a cost benefit analysis were conducted to determine if dropping print subscriptions in favor of electronic would still meet the needs of the patron and be cost effective for the hospital. This has led to keeping only a select few journals in both print and electronic. In addition to creating lists of the materials and where they are located, we also had to deal with accessibility issues for patrons both inside and outside the hospital. Patrons using the journals and databases via the intranet had to have Internet privileges. If they do not have Internet privileges, they cannot search them from the hospital network. If they use the intranet and have Internet privileges, we provide Internet protocol (IP) authentication to the journals and databases. But those patrons who want to access them from their home or office via the Internet, must have an ID and password to get to the databases. We continue to look for other ways to manage electronic journals and books so that our standards of high-quality service to our patrons will be maintained."
"The odyssey of a lifetime: a manual review of MeSH authority records in a local catalog","Wendy Fritzel, cataloger, J. Otto Lottes Health Sciences Library, University of Missouri–Columbia","It is important for authority records to have the fullest number of valid cross-references possible, because it helps ensure that patrons have subject access to the materials they need. To ensure the quality of MeSH authority records in the MERLIN consortium catalog (an Innovative Interfaces, Inc., system), a periodic review of the records is done. MERLIN libraries are those of the University of Missouri campuses (St. Louis, Columbia, Kansas City, and Rolla) and St. Louis University. Although the consortium utilizes authority service from a vendor (OCLC/WLN MARS®), this has been suspended for approximately two years. Because of this, and the fact that the last review of the authority records was five years ago, it was decided to compare the MeSH authority records against the 2000 MeSH Annotated Alphabetic List and the MeSH Browser located on the Internet (www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/Mbrowser.html). The aim of the project was to ensure the completeness of authority records in the local catalog by updating them with cross references present in the 2000 MeSH Annotated Alphabetic List or in the MeSH Browser. Early on in the project, it was decided to keep track of the number headings in the local catalog that required updating with cross-references. The project began in January 2000 and continues. The plan is simple: locate the MeSH authority record in MERLIN by subject search and then compare the cross references to those in the 2000 MeSH Annotated Alphabetic List and in the MeSH Browser. The reason why the MeSH Browser was also used for comparison is that it often contains more cross-references than the Annotated Alphabetic List. Also, we could copy and paste headings from the MeSH Browser into our local catalog, saving typing time. Data was gathered on all alphabetical entries from F–O (n = 5561). Forty-seven percent of these were found in the MERLIN catalog, with 13% requiring the addition of cross references."

"The loanable arrangers: technology shared between departments","Carol Thornton, reference and education librarian; Rhona S. Kelley, AHIP, head, Reference and Education Services; and Fran Kovach, AHIP, reference and education librarian; School of Medicine Library, Southern Illinois University–Springfield","Purpose: This poster illustrates collaboration between two departments making a wide range of electronic equipment available to medical school faculty, students, and staff on a split campus. Settings/subjects: The Southern Illinois University (SIU) School of Medicine is split between two campuses, Springfield and Carbondale, a distance of 174.4 miles. The SIU Medical Library is located in Springfield and the Department of Information Resources has personnel on both campuses. The school has a new curriculum that mandates using technology such as distance learning, videoconferencing, and the Internet. Not all departments can afford to buy the necessary equipment or have knowledge about its use. Brief Description: The Medical Library and Information Resources formed a strategy of acquiring electronic equipment that could be shared by all departments on both campuses. This would avoid unnecessary duplication of expensive equipment and make it possible for departments to have access to a far wider range than they could have individually. The collection of loanable technology varies from laptop computers and projectors to battery chargers, networking cards, and handheld televisions. The library and Information Resources have promoted the availability of the equipment by exhibiting at school functions and by designing a Website that includes information about the equipment available as well as what items are needed to perform functions such as distance learning or videoconferencing. Results/Outcome: Some items are very popular, and equipment continues to be added to the pool of loanable equipment. Evaluation Methods: Usage of loanable items is tracked in several ways. Library items are checked out in the online catalog and monthly reports can be generated. Information Resources items are recorded in a spreadsheet when they are checked out and returned. Reports can be produced from the spreadsheet. SIU keeps statistics on the number of hits on each Web page, so it is possible to monitor usage of the Website."

Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas–Houston","University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center needed a way to increase user awareness of its resources and services. The celebration of National Medical Librarians Month provided a practical venue to showcase the library and heighten user awareness throughout the institution. Several special open house events were held that demonstrated Internet resources and full-text online journals. The open house events also allowed the library to introduce its recently completed state-of-the-art computer classroom. An exhibit promoting services and programs of the National Network of Libraries of Medicine was displayed in a central location in the library. To promote the celebration, articles were published in the institution’s weekly newsletter; posters were displayed in strategic locations throughout the institution; flyers were distributed with interlibrary loan mailings; electronic notices were placed on library public workstations; and promotional materials such as bookmarks, banners, and buttons were created. This poster session will address the objectives, methodology, and results of coordinating a National Medical Librarians Month celebration at the Research Medical Library."
"Ne. Bytes: an electronic user awareness service","Kathryn J. Hoffman, executive director; Wes H. Browning, assistant director, Information Systems; and Brett S. Powers, reference and education librarian; M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas–Houston","University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center needed a timely and efficient way to alert users to new library resources and services. The library has built a successful Web presence at the institution, and it was felt that an email-based monthly newsletter would be a natural extension to reach a large user base of busy physicians and students. The newsletter was designed to be easy to read and brief in content. Such items as new electronic full-text resources, databases, classes, Websites, and library services would be addressed in each issue. The service was subscription based and was promoted via flyers, notices on the library Web page, and a mass email to the institution. Electronic and paper registration forms allowed users to easily subscribe to the service. A Web-based version of the newsletter, along with a past issues archive, was also created on the library’s Website. Readers assessed the service via an electronic survey. This poster session will address the objectives for implementation, the methodology used in creating and maintaining the newsletter, and user survey results."
"Using EndNote for electronic journal management in a hospital library","Melissa L. Just, AHIP, director, Library Services, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, Health Sciences Library, Los Angeles, CA","Providing links to and information about electronic journals from the library Website takes a large amount of time and effort. Many libraries use database systems with Web interfaces that build lists on the fly. Although this is feasible in libraries with dedicated Web managers or strong institutional technology support, smaller libraries often do not have the expertise or tools for database solutions. At the Children’s Hospital Health Sciences Library, a hospital library with a half-time librarian, managing electronic resources seemed an impossible task. Because of the hospital’s affiliation with Children’s Hospital, hundreds of e-journals are available to the staff. One option was to hard code an alphabetic list of e-resources using an HTML editor. However, once created, the list would be time consuming to modify. Separate lists would also need to be created for different subject categories. A database solution seemed necessary. Even though the librarian was unfamiliar with standard relational database programs, she was familiar with EndNote, a personal bibliographic management program. With a little knowledge of HTML and a copy of EndNote, managing e-resource lists became easy. Once the software is configured and the data entered, the librarian can produce lists alphabetically and by subject in HTML format. If necessary, the HTML design can be easily updated and resources may be added or deleted quickly. Links to the resources and descriptions can also be included.

Varman, and Deborah Halsted, director, Library Operations, Texas Medical Center Library, Houston Academy of Medicine, Houston, TX","The Texas Medical Center Library, Houston Academy of Medicine (HAM-TMC) Library is one of twelve libraries nationwide, and the only medical library, selected to receive funding for local programming related to the On Our Own Terms: Moyers on Dying, a special Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) series hosted by Bill Moyers. The purpose of the funding was to create and develop a community resource guide on end-of-life care information to be widely distributed, plan four community discussion forums to reach health professionals as well as the general public to discuss physical, psychological, emotional, and spiritual issues related to the end of life and develop a collection on end-of-life care resources in the library. The library partnered with multiple community organizations including KUHT Houston Public Television. Programs included phone-in sessions with local experts following the final Moyers broadcast and a large community forum held on a Saturday. Future library forums will continue to stimulate dialog and encourage discussions in different aspects on end-of-life issues and make people aware of the different resources available in the library. Videos and books have been added to the consumer health collection, which circulates to the general public."
"Providing consumer health information to Asian Americans: a collaborative model","Deborah Halsted, director, Library Operations, and Marsha Sullivan, consumer health librarian, Texas Medical Center Library, Houston Academy of Medicine, Houston, TX","According to the 1999 U.S. Census Bureau, the Asian population in Houston has increased 67.2% in the last ten years. To provide outreach to these underserved residents, the library staff worked with community leaders and our Friends of the Library group to plan and implement Asian health kiosks. These kiosks were equipped with consumer health information in Chinese and Vietnamese. Health materials in other Asian languages will be added throughout the coming year. Future plans include an Asian-language Web page, onsite computers, and train-thetrainer courses. This poster traces the path of planning, collection development, implementation, and long-range goals for the kiosks located in Asian-specific areas of our city. The objective of this session is to provide librarians with ideas for implementing programs to serve the Asian segment of their citizenry. A bibliography of consumer health resources in Vietnamese and Chinese will be provided."
"Electronic whiteboard technology: an odyssey in information sharing in the classroom or the exhibit hall","Judy Burnham, AHIP, assistant director, Administrative and Regional Services; Geneva Bush Staggs, AHIP, assistant director, Public Services and Education; and Everly Brown, AHIP, circuit librarian; Baugh Biomedical Library, University of South Alabama–Mobile","In a classroom, the librarian must keep the students focused on the topic at hand. At an exhibit, it is necessary for the librarian to attract and keep the attention of the meeting participants. Using the electronic whiteboard in both of these types of situations can enable the instructor or the exhibitor to enhance the presentation. Electronic whiteboard technology combines the simplicity of a whiteboard with the power of a computer to become an interactive tool in the classroom or the exhibit hall. Using a computer connected to a data projector allows the instructor to access and display information from the Internet by touching the screen. The instructor can also use video from a camera or VCR or deliver CD-ROM or other multi-media resources, by simply touching the electronic whiteboard. As on a traditional whiteboard, the instructor can use a colored pen and write on or highlight the application to illustrate a point. In a classroom, learning experiences are enhanced and principles of information access are clarified by using a combination of the electronic whiteboard, computer, data projector, PowerPoint slides, and Web demonstrations. In the exhibit hall, the use of the electronic whiteboard with a data projector and Web access allows for a larger projection area and easy demonstration of appropriate Websites This poster will highlight applications of the electronic whiteboard in both the classroom and the exhibit hall. It will include techniques, pros, and cons of using the electronic whiteboard technology."
"A model for staff development planning in an academic health sciences library","Rebecca Abromitis, reference librarian, Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic Library; Linda Hartman, reference librarian, Falk Library of the Health Sciences; and Alice Kuller, reference librarian, Falk Library of the Health Sciences; University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA","A Staff Development Committee (SDC) was convened in January 1999 to implement staff development opportunities at our university’s health sciences libraries. Both the university and affiliated medical center offer many personal and professional enrichment programs, and the SDC was charged with utilizing this rich environment to:s1. develop programs to enhance workplace skills and personal growth, 2. communicate the availability of existing programs at the university and medical center, 3. encourage the staff to participate in these opportunities. When the SDC was organized, approximately sixty-seven FTE library staff worked in three separate locations that included a health sciences, a psychiatry, and a nursing library. Implementation of an ongoing staff development program was viewed as a way to help improve communication in the workplace, provide personal enrichment, and develop camaraderie among staff members in the three libraries. The seven-member committee created goals and objectives and developed a survey designed to give staff the opportunity to provide input for this initiative. With a 60% response rate, the survey results were used to plan fifteen events based on staff needs and preferences. Successful first-year events included software training, email training, a supervisory skills class, a customer service workshop, a civic volunteer project, a baseball game, a play, and four "brown bag" lectures. In addition, eight "open house" sessions were held to highlight the unique functions of each department or library within the library system. Total attendance for SDC sponsored events from July 1,1999–June 30, 2000, was 459. Committee members serve as liaisons for each event. Two forms were developed to facilitate event planning: "Program Planning & Event Evaluation Form" and "Checklist of Responsibilities for Event Liaisons." A monthly announcement sheet, email reminders, and an internal Website are used to communicate upcoming SDC events and encourage attendance. The structured approach to planning the first year of programs resulted in a diverse offering attended by all levels of staff, from shelvers to administrators. This approach can serve as a useful model for similar program planning in any organization."
"Iowa Health Information Outreach (IHIO): delivering health information to rural and underserved Iowa health care professionals","Neville D. Prendergast, coordinator, Information and Educational Services, and Sandra Phelps, reference librarian, Hardin Library for the Health Sciences, University of Iowa–Iowa City","The Hardin Library for the Health Sciences, University of Iowa, was awarded a National Library of Medicine, National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NN/LM) Greater Midwest Region (GMR) outreach grant, November 1, 1999–April 30, 2001, for a project titled "Enabling Access to Health Information Resources for Non-Metropolitan and Underserved Health Professionals in Iowa." The project goal is to provide health care professionals in non-metropolitan and underserved areas of Iowa knowledge and skills that will empower and enable them to use Internetbased resources effectively and to incorporate these into their practice, so that available health information resources will drive their decision making and patient care agendas. Seven health care professional groups—physicians, dentists, pharmacists, nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and psychologists—in nine rural Iowa counties were identified and targeted. The project is in three phases. Phase I: site visits to these counties were arranged. Each visit was a two-hour, hands-on Internet training session covering PubMed, MEDLINEplus, and Internet basics. Trainers have two available laptops with Internet connectivity. This first phase included a preliminary information access survey to determine participants’ access to and use of the Internet, U.S. library resources, and databases. Each session was evaluated by participants. A project Web page was developed to provide specific ready access to Web resources. Phase II: a video-conference broadcast over Iowa Communications Network (ICN) to all six sites from Hardin Library. This was designed to demonstrate health information Web resources, particularly those of the University of Iowa and Hardin Library, search engines, and a presentation on evaluating Internet resources. The upcoming Phase III will be a second set of visits. These sessions will be hands-on to reaffirm PubMed training, addressing questions on Internet access, continuing information seeking options beyond the project period, and document delivery. Participants in five of the seven professional groups were eligible for continuing-education credits for Phases I and II. Other successes include increased awareness of and access to Internet health information resources like PubMed, heightened appreciation for Internet connectivity, more use of document delivery options, and the IHIO Web page. The presentation will include detailed statistics."
"The 'best' lists: health sciences libraries, medical schools, and where you are ranked by","Kelly Hensley, AHIP, assistant professor/interlibrary loan librarian, Sherrodd Library, East Tennessee State University–Johnson City","Purpose: Discuss the controversial ranking of professional schools by media such as U.S. News and World Report and others; compare these lists to the quantitative data health sciences libraries as benchmarks to determine the importance of information resource in the "best lists" rankings. Methodology: Statistical analysis and comparison. Results: The rankings of three "top ten" or "best schools" have become almost an annual event, with even medical schools touting their rankings on these lists, despite the shaky methodologies. Lists of medical schools were compared for reliability of the varying methodologies. A ranked list of health sciences libraries resources was compared to the "best" lists to determine any correlation between the ranking of institutes and their libraries. Discussion/Conclusion: In this ongoing project, the "best" lists of medical schools typically, but not always, correspond within a standard deviation of lists of "best" libraries, as judged by such factors as amount spent annually on resources."
"Signs of the times: images of women in medical and pharmaceutical advertisements, 1900–2000","Kelly Hensley, AHIP, assistant professor/interlibrary loan librarian, Sherrod Library, East Tennessee State University–Johnson City","Purpose: Describe trends in the depiction of women in advertisements in medical journals and magazines aimed at physicians; link to developments in broader culture. Methodology: Journal content analysis. Results: Analysis of the advertising content of more than forty medical journals from the turn of the nineteenth to the turn of the twentieth century revealed a mirroring of the greater society. Early in the 1900s, there were few advertisements in medical journals, which were supported by subscription fees or dues. As the emerging pharmaceutical and medical industry developed more products, ads began to appear in journals. Currently, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association estimates that almost 9% of sales revenue is spent on publicity; the Food and Drug Administration puts that figure at 24%. The resulting flow of advertising content has depicted women in a variety of ways, directed toward an audience of health care professionals. Discussion/Conclusion: Physicians have been and continue to be exposed to current stereotypes about women in advertisements that appear in medical journals."
