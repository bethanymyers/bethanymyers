"Assessing medical student informatics competencies","Brynn E. Mays, assistant director, Education Services, and Jane L. Blumenthal, AHIP, director and assistant dean, Knowledge Management, Dahlgren Memorial Library; Jeffrey M. Weinfeld, assistant professor, Department of Family Medicine; and Marcus A. Banks, AHIP, NLM associate fellow, and Janette Shaffer, education coordinator, Dahlgren Memorial Library; Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC","Objective: We collaborated with medical school faculty to develop a curriculum-integrated posttest model to assess informatics competencies in the medical school curriculum. Methods: An interdepartmental informatics curriculum committee was formed to review in which courses informatics concepts were taught throughout the four-year curriculum and to draft updated learning objectives. Through this faculty- librarian collaboration, we identified one preclinical course and one clinical clerkship in which to pilot an instructional intervention and tailored assignment for assessing student competencies. Faculty and librarians worked together to identify outcomes and indicators, create relevant assignments, and teach students information retrieval and information management skills. Results: In the 'Introduction to Health Care' course, all first- year students completed a community health informatics project. Twenty-five percent attended a voluntary library help session or sought librarian assistance in finding county-level data. Qualitative observation of 39 presentations indicated that all 39 students found information relevant to their assignment. Only 44% clearly documented their sources, making it difficult to objectively assess the quality of the information. In the third-year family medicine clerkship, faculty-librarian teams taught evidence-based medicine workshops. Students completed a clinical question worksheet and documented search strategies. During this pilot phase, the worksheets were not graded. Student feedback provided additional insights. Conclusions: Faculty-librarian collaboration aided the development of appropriate, relevant assignments for preclinical and clinical education. Coteaching by faculty- librarian teams emphasized the integrated nature of informatics competencies and enhanced the teaching experience. More work is needed to develop appropriate assessment strategies."
"Power of improved practice: taking information management education to the next level","Jeanne Sadlik, coordinator, Research & Education Services, and Logan Ludwig, associate dean, Health Sciences Library/ Media Services/Telemedicine, Loyola Health Sciences Library, Stritch School of Medicine, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL","Objective: To integrate knowledge-based information into the curriculum by using an electronic learning management system and to demonstrate students' competencies in searching databases for evidence-based-medicine literature. Methods: Setting: Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine (SSOM) Maywood, Illinois Population: 130 third-year medical students Project Description: Since 1995, librarians held one-hour sessions with all third-year medical students at the start of clerkship rotations in July. In these sessions, students were taught research techniques necessary to identify evidence- based-medicine (EBM) literature. This class focused on teaching the students to use logical, analytical thinking combined with advanced searching skills to search MEDLINE. These skills enable the students to search the literature and critically evaluate articles identified to support their clinical decisions. In 2003, the librarians developed a computer-based learning (CBL) module, 'Searching for Evidence-Based- Medicine Literature,' to take the place of the instructor-led sessions. The CBL consisted of thirty-six slides and a ten- question posttest (random questions from a pool of 20) followed by survey questions. This module supports SSOM's move toward competency-based education. The data collected from the completion of the CBL demonstrate the competencies of the students in searching the literature for EBM information. All third-year students were notified by email of the need to complete the CBL by the end of July. Instructions for accessing the system were included. Results: One hundred thirty third-year medical students completed the evidence-based medicine CBL module. The average test score was 90%; 124 of the 130 students passed the posttest on the first try; 23 students attempted to complete the posttest without looking at the course material. Out of these 23, 20 passed the test on the first attempt. Sixty-three percent of the students found the information presented helpful in understanding how to search for EBM literature; 84% preferred completing the CBL module to an instructor-led class. Conclusion: This pilot study showed that using a CBL module was an effective way to teach research techniques necessary to identify EBM literature. Because of the success of this program, in the future, all third-year students will be required to complete the CBL module."
"Library support of the service-learning curriculum in an academic medical center","Marcus A. Banks, AHIP, associate fellow, Dahlgren Memorial Library, and Donna D. Cameron, service-learning director, Department of Family Medicine, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC","Objective: As part of the 'Introduction to Health Care' (IHC) course, self-selected first-year medical students participate in a service-based team project. Teams of students conduct health education and outreach at selected community sites, and faculty team leaders relate their experiences to course concepts. This project evaluated how the medical center library could improve its support of this program. Methods: As initial background for the project, a library fellow met with the service-learning director to determine the demographics and health profiles of the various locations visited by the students. The fellow also met with the IHC course director to learn his perspective regarding how the library could support this project. Soon after the students began conducting site visits, the fellow and service-learning director met with them to learn about additional resources that would be useful. We then observed the final session conducted by students at selected community sites, in order to gauge how they incorporated health information into their instruction and to ascertain how community members felt about the quality of the information they received. The perspectives of faculty, students, and community members helped to inform the library's collection of culturally appropriate and engaging consumer health resources. Results: Once a week for six weeks of the spring semester, a team of eight students met with eight residents of a group home for teenage mothers. The library fellow attended the first and last of these sessions, in order to promote the library as a useful resource for consumer health information. During this period, two of the eight students sought the fellow's assistance. Based upon their questions, the fellow informed all students about relevant resources. At the final session, students and mothers created a bulletin board of health information at the residential facility, which included information provided by the fellow. Conclusions: This was a good beginning to a collaboration that should expand. Future steps will include creation of a Web page of links to consumer health resources. Because the preparation for community service visits occurs during fall semester, it would be preferable for a librarian to build rapport with students then."
"Internet Web-based materials in family medicine education: a national survey","Helen G. Mayo, manager, Campus Outreach, UT Southwestern Library; Cassie L. Murphey-Cullen, assistant professor; Alice K. Marcee, faculty associate; and Gregory W. Schneider, assistant professor; UT Southwestern Family Practice Residency Program; Richard V. King, associate professor, UT Southwestern Biomedical Communications; and Robert D. Frey, assistant professor, UT Southwestern Family Practice Residency Program; University of Texas Southwestern Medical Centerâ€“Dallas","Objective: To determine family residents' actual experience with and desired exposure to computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), the Internet, and Web-based information for clinical and educational activities. Methods: Programs listed in the American Academy of Family Physicians 2002 directory of Family Practice Residency Programs were divided into five categories based on affiliation and structure of the residency program. The 456 programs were community based (CB), community based and medical school affiliated (CBMSAF), community based and medical school administered (CBMSAD), medical school based (MS), and military. Random samples of programs within each of the first four categories were selected to participate in the study. Military programs were excluded. A total of 312 programs were selected: CB (24), CBMSAF (159), CBMSAD (73), and MS (56). A survey packet containing a 14-item questionnaire for each resident and a letter of explanation regarding the study was mailed to 312 randomly selected programs. Residents reported on their own access to computers and PDAs at home and in the office, their use of the Internet for personal use and clinical information, and their preferences for accessing information currently provided at teaching conferences, for national board exam preparation, and at clinical point-of-care. Results: The CBMSAF returned 600 surveys (49.3%); CD returned 60 surveys (4.8%); CBMSAD returned 300 surveys (25.5%); MS returned 240 surveys (20.4%). For statistical analysis, the CBMSAF and CB were combined into 'community centric,' and the CBMSAD and MS were combined into 'medical school centric' program types. Most residents have access to the Internet, a home computer, and a PDA. There is a statistically significant difference in self- reported Web search skills between community centric and medical school centric residents, but this difference disappears when residents are asked if they are able to find clinically useful information during their Web searches. Conclusion: Family practice residents' access to the Internet and computer-based information is very well established. There is a disconnect between the number residents that report advanced Web search skills and those who report finding clinically useful information. This has implications for teaching residents how to better use Internet-based resources."
"Empowering preceptors for teaching with technology: a change in practice","Brenda Seago, AHIP, director, Computer Based Instruction Lab, and Judy Gary, educational coordinator, Department of Family Practice, School of Medicine; Shannon Jones, NLM second year associate fellow, Tompkins-McCaw Library; Dan Han, info tech analyst, Computer Based Instruction Lab, and Chris Stephens, director, Applications Development, Office of Faculty and Instructional Development, School of Medicine; Indra Kancitis, Foundations of Clinical Medicine coordinator, Department of Pediatrics; and Rita Willett, director, Foundations of Clinical Medicine Course; Virginia Commonwealth Universityâ€“Richmond","Purpose: This project assesses the outcomes of integrating the practical use of technology in a community practice setting on physician-preceptor teaching at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). Methods: The VCU School of Medicine distributed 10 IBM ThinkPads, funded by the VCU Faculty Laptop Initiative, to physician-preceptors to assist them with teaching. Faculty from the Foundations of Clinical Medicine (FCM) course, the Computer Based Instruction Lab, and Tompkins-McCaw Library collaborated to identify preceptors; provide training in computer use, online curriculum, and library resources for evidence-based medicine; and to deliver laptops to preceptors. Ten preceptors were selected from over 300 primary care physicians who have students in their offices during the students first 2 years of medical school. Participation was voluntary and required access to high speed Internet in the home or office. An email discussion list and bulletin board were established to facilitate communication with FCM staff and preceptors to improve medical student teaching. Also, a preceptor Website was developed to support the ongoing exchange of information between community preceptors and the FCM staff. Results: During December 2003 and January 2004, the ten laptops were delivered to either the physician's home or office and training was provided in PubMed, StatRef, Micromedex, School of Medicine online curricula, and medical resources on the Internet. Preceptors were introduced to the email discussion list and discussion forum. The preceptor Website debuted after the training and includes teaching guides for M-I and M-II students, links to relevant teaching resources and the electronic bulletin board, and announcements about upcoming programs. Conclusions: A focus group was conducted at a clinical skills workshop on campus. Preceptors rated the training an A+. The email discussion list and Web-based discussion forum were ranked valuable with potential, although neither had been used extensively. The Website also received positive feedback; the preceptors appreciated knowing the resources were available."
"Multidisciplinary medical case study development for first-year medical students","Dan Kipnis, education services librarian; Tony Frisby, director, Education Services; and Liz Mikita, education services librarian; Academic Information Services and Research, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA","Objective: To teach medical informatics skills to 232 first-year medical students using three online medical case studies developed with the collaboration of librarians, physicians, and instructional designers. Methods: The first formal medical informatics class at Jefferson Medical College was created in 1987. Initially a traditional combination of lectures and hands-on workshops, the course was redesigned in 1996 to be a single two-hour lecture and 9 self-paced computer-based learning hours. In 2003 the Jefferson Medical College curriculum was changed from a traditional core study in the basic sciences during the first year to a system-based model. At this time, many free- standing courses such as medical informatics were integrated into a new course, 'Medical Practice for the 21st Century.' The content presented in the new course included medical informatics, medical ethics and humanities, biostatistics, health policy, and clinical history and examination skills. Each of these courses presented relevant content in synch with the body system functions of the new combined gross anatomy, histology, biochemistry, and physiology course, 'Human Form and Development.' This poster will describe the history of the medical informatics course and the process of designing the case studies to fit into the new course management system, and will review the experiences of the librarians involved. Results: The following proved to be challenges: â€¢ Finding physicians to develop credible case studies (we also got help from a nurse and dietician) â€¢ Adapting the case studies to a commercial course management system â€¢ Grading answers from 232 medical students â€¢ Providing personalized feedback to at least 3 out of 14 questions per student â€¢ Dealing with technical issues â€¢ Developing questions/answers that could assess hard to measure search strategies and skills (and be graded automatically) â€¢ Taking into account that databases are a moving target (search results can change from day to day) Conclusions: Recruit medical staff to help develop realistic case studies, minimize ambiguity in test questions, and construct meaningful assessments given the structure and limitations of a course management system. Develop exercises that build information literacy skills in a method that encourages self-directed learning but allows for individualized attention when necessary."
"Combined power: integration of medical informatics curriculum into problem-based learning course for first- year medical students.","Laura Abate, electronic resources & instructional librarian; Anne Linton, AHIP, director; and Patricia Wilson, associate director, Public Services; Himmelfarb Health Sciences Library, The George Washington University, Washington, DC","Objective: Integration and restructuring of medical informatics and problem-based learning curricula to improve resource selection and search skills, to boost recall of informatics topics, to provide point-of-use learning and instruction, and to enhance student experience. Methods: Librarians developed and taught 'Introduction to Medical Informatics,' a required pass/fail course to first-year medical students, through the 2002/03 school year. In 2003/04, 'Introduction to Medical Informatics' was renamed 'PBL Informatics' and integrated with 'Problem-Based Learning' in which students research and discuss individual medical cases. Students completed an online curriculum including tasks and quizzes and demonstrated proficiency with specific computer applications. Librarians were matched with individual PBL groups, acted as advisors to students in their research, and guided students through PBL's informatics-related curriculum. Increased librarian participation in PBL groups was initiated in part by student feedback requesting closer integration. To restructure the medical informatics online curriculum, the original twelve sessions were reduced to six through consolidation and elimination. Each of the six sessions contains a written lecture and quiz and is matched with a PBL case. As students progress through a PBL case, informatics issues arise that are mirrored in the online informatics curriculum. In addition, at two of the four group meetings per case, librarians make brief (5â€“10 minutes) presentations to their PBL groups on topics drawn from the informatics curriculum and the PBL case. Results: The success of 'PBL Informatics' relies on additional librarian time and student contact over previous years, closer collaboration with the PBL faculty to rewrite PBL cases to include informatics topics, and increased interaction with each group's faculty tutor. Positive feedback has been received from students, course directors, faculty tutors, and faculty librarians. Student selection of information resources improved over the previous year, and students consistently cited high-quality resources in their papers and presentations. Conclusions: The integration of the medical informatics and PBL curricula has been successful. Future efforts will likely involve continued rewriting and restructuring of PBL cases to incorporate informatics concepts and to hone information- seeking and evaluation skills."
"Improved practice: distributed library instruction to nursing students","Kate Finkelstein, outreach librarian, Dahlgren Memorial Library, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC, and Marie Reidelbach, associate director, User Services, and associate professor, and Alison Bobal, reference/digital services librarian, McGoogan Library of Medicine, University of Nebraska Medical Centerâ€“Omaha","Objectives: This poster will describe the process by which an academic health sciences library created digital video tutorials and distributed them via CD-ROM. This poster will evaluate: â€¢ process of creating the CDs â€¢ effectiveness of the instructional digital videos â€¢ content presented in each learning module â€¢ whether the library should continue this mode of user instruction Methods: This academic health sciences library serves an increasing number of distance students, most of whom enroll through the university's College of Nursing. Most of these students visit the campus only once each semester during course orientation, making scarce opportunities for effective library instruction. In August 2003, the library distributed over ninety CDs containing nine screen-captured tutorials to all College of Nursing distance students. This group included all students enrolled in the RN to BSN and graduate/doctoral programs, as well as BSN students taking online courses. The library created a survey instrument to assess the perceived usefulness and effectiveness of this mode of instruction. The library contacted forty-eight students who received the CDs and asked them to anonymously complete the online survey. Of the forty-eight surveys distributed, twenty-seven were returned (56%) and of those twenty-seven responses, sixteen students used and evaluated the CD. All user feedback was positive regarding the usefulness of the CD. About half of the students answered that, in addition to receiving the CD, they would have also liked a hands-on instructional session. Respondents commented that the CD was helpful throughout the semester whenever they needed to do library research. Based on the survey comments, the library will continue to distribute similar CDs, in addition to on-campus instruction sessions during orientation. Additionally, the library will place the video tutorials online for wider distribution of the modules."
"'Having an information problem? We'll help you lick it!' The Library Survivor Tour","Marilyn A. Rosen, biomedical information specialist, and Angela Dixon, head, Collection Management, and biomedical information specialist, Edward G. Miner library, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY","Purpose: This poster will present our redesign of the orientation week tour for first-year medical students, in which we incorporated the needs of various styles of learners. Setting/Participants/Resources: The tour was conducted in an academic health sciences library serving a school of medicine and dentistry, a school of nursing, and a 690-bed hospital. Every August, all first-year medical students are required to tour the library. Brief Description: Two members of the reference staff and the educational coordinator developed a scavenger hunt with the reality game show theme of Survivor. The medical students named their teams, then proceeded to answer thirteen questions within twenty minutes. They 'hunted' in a variety of library locations and in numerous electronic resources. Usability questions on our new Website were also included. The tour ended with a wrap-up review session, in which every student was a winner. Each student received a library mug filled with candy and a gift certificate. The winning teams were awarded a Medical School Survival Kit. Results/Outcome: The students became familiar with the library layout, resources, and services in an upbeat, interactive, lively atmosphere. Librarians and staff were viewed as more approachable (who wouldn't smile at a person wearing a pith helmet?). Evaluation Method: A survey was emailed after the tour, outlining its goals and asking the students if they felt the goals were met. Comments received indicated the students' enthusiasm for, and appreciation of, the tour."
"Information literacy for med I students: testing their knowledge and our effectiveness","Melissa L. Just, AHIP, information specialist, and Eileen Eandi, information specialist, Norris Medical Library, University of Southern Californiaâ€“Los Angeles","Objective: To determine medical students' levels of information literacy. To provide an information literacy instructional session. To deliver a posttest to determine the effectiveness of instruction. Methods: The University of Southern California's (USC's) Norris Medical Library has participated in the Keck School of Medicine's student orientation for years by providing MEDLINE instruction. In 2000, the school instituted a case- based learning model, and the library was invited to participate more fullyâ€”first, by adding a yearlong, course-integrated MEDLINE searching assignment, then by adding more library training time to orientation week. The library decided to add a general information literacy (IL) component to the orientation session but did not have any concrete knowledge of the incoming students' skills. Librarians developed a course to teach students basic IL skills needed for becoming more efficient and effective self-directed learners. A test was developed to administer as both a pre- and posttest. The pretest determined students' IL skills before the course. The posttest determined what knowledge students gained during the class and served as a measure of course effectiveness. Also, students were asked to rate the quality of the course based on two measures: (1) percentage of content already known, and (2) helpfulness of content. This poster summarizes the course content, presents results of the pre- and posttests, addresses students' satisfaction, and draws conclusions about the future of the course. Results: In 2003, the students scored an average of 80.1% on the pretest, suggesting that they entered medical school with a solid understanding of basic IL. After the sessions, the average score was 93.4%. Although the overall scores increased (percent change = 16.6%), the scores on two of the questions decreased, suggesting the students 'unlearned' some information during the class. Students self-reported that they already knew an average of 62.6% of course content (considerably lower than the pretest suggested), and 75.0% reported that the information session was helpful. Conclusions: The library will continue to offer the orientation session but focus on USC-specific resources, rather than reviewing general information literacy. Instructors will review their teaching practices to ensure that all class material is presented clearly."
"The Clinical Connections Program: a chance to seize the power and profit from collaboration","Karen V. Knight, AHIP, medical education liaison; Gabriel R. Rios, assistant director, Information Services and Technology; Andrea S. Horne, learning resources manager; Elaine May Attridge, AHIP, nursing and clinical liaison; and Gretchen Naisawald Arnold, AHIP, associate director, Library Operations, Claude Moore Health Sciences Library, University of Virginia Health Systemâ€“Charlottesville","Objective: The School of Medicine's Clinical Connections Program is an opportunity for third-year medical students to meet several times a year for full day discussions around a selected clinical topic. In 2002 and 2003, the Health Sciences Library was invited to develop a Clinical Connections Day around the theme of information technology. This collaboration has powered new beneficial library connections. Methods: The Clinical Connections Program runs throughout the third-year, providing students with a continuing medical education type experience of large group presentations and small group workshops around topics of clinical interest. For the past two years, the library's program 'Medical Information Technology: New Tools for the Bedside and Beyond' has occurred first in the year-long series and provides the medical students with an opportunity to acquire a practical introduction to new information technologies and issues surrounding their use in health care that will be pertinent in their clinical experiences. This poster will elaborate on the power of process improvement from year one to year two based on the changes made to the library's Clinical Connections Day from student evaluation data and the many benefits that derived from the library's involvement. Results: The student evaluations from the first year, while good, reflected the need for some changes. We responded to student's feedback while planning the second year's program. The major changes included an increased focus on clinically relevant information technologies that appealed to the student's 'here and now survival mode' and pulling in residents and clinicians to facilitate small group case-based work with personal digital assistants (PDAs). These changes resulted in an eleven percentage point improvement in evaluations from the second year. Another plus for the library was the ability to insert point of need training on PDAs, Micromedex, and evidence-based medicine searching into the curriculum. Conclusions: This unique experience provided the library with an opportunity to collaborate with other departments and faculty members in the health system who are working to develop and implement information management systems. In addition, the sessions have provided greater time for library- related training in the student's third year."
"Power of the nursing shortage","Keydi M. Boss, librarian, Bartholomew Medial Library, Holy Name Hospital, Teaneck, NJ","Objective: To acquire new computers for the School of Nursing Library. Methods: The School of Nursing Library used the power of the nursing shortage to justify the acquisition of a new software package and subsequently replaced all the computers in the library. Results: Prior to the acquisition of the Learning Systems by Meds Publishing, the library had fifteen computers. Three were not working at all. The remainder was at maximum capacity and had no available memory or hard drive space for new programs. Only three of the computers were Internet accessible. My poster will illustrate how the acquisition of the Learning Systems has made an impact on our nursing students' test taking success and has enabled me to replace all of the library's computers and acquire an additional network computer. Conclusion: Technology upgrades are expensive. The School of Nursing library was in competition with other departments for monies to support an upgrade. I seized the power of the nursing shortage to acquire Learning Systems that provided the justification for upgrading our computers."
"End user empowerment: selecting and integrating a clinical electronic reference based on clinician choice: the numbers speak volumes","Terrie R. Wheeler, library director, Library and Medical Media, VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, Pittsburgh, PA; Mary E. Nourse, AHIP, library director, Medical Library, Erie VA Medical Center, Erie, PA; and Robert S. Lyle, library director, Medical Library, Philadelphia VA Medical Center, Philadelphia, PA","Objective: To identify an electronic resource that would synthesize the most current evidence-based medical practices available and is designed so the busy clinician could intuitively locate specific answers to queries in a few clicks while seeing patients. Studies show that clinical questions arise for clinicians while actively seeing patients, yet nearly all go unanswered because of time and resource limits. Methods: In 2000, a survey was sent to all primary care clinicians in this health care network to identify their primary source of information. Of 203 surveys sent, 119 were returned, a 59% response rate. Of those who responded, 45% relied most heavily on textbooks, 13% relied most heavily on journals, and 28% relied most heavily on electronic resources for their primary source of clinical information. No uniform electronic products had been deployed prior to this survey. This same survey asked what electronic products clinicians used most, if they used electronic products. We learned that providers preferred the use of UpToDate. After an evaluation of this product, it was deployed in mid-2001 and integrated into the electronic medical record throughout our network, for easy availability when clinicians are seeing patients. Our hypothesis is that this intervention will meet some clinical information needs. Results: Utilization of UpToDate by ten medical centers was monitored weekly by number of access sessions and unique users. Data demonstrate an overall incremental increase in UpToDate usage in VISN 4 over a three-year period from 2001â€“2003. A total of 65,060 clinical questions were answered at the point of care. We hypothesize several reasons for the steadily increased usage: 1. Accessibility: EMR GUI toolbar, desktops, Web pages 2. Physician champions 3. Increasingly sophisticated providers 4. Intuitive interface; requiring minimal clicks to access information sought 5. Timeliness: updated regularly 6. Improved speed of WAN 7 . Integration of knowledge-based information into daily patient care 8. Increasingly sophisticated patient population Conclusions: This project was successful because it integrated succinct and intuitive knowledge-based information into the EMR, affording the provider the opportunity to incorporate evidence-based medical literature into real-time patient care situations and answering the 70% of questions the literature showed would go unanswered previous to this intervention."
"Seizing the power of collaboration and partnership in educating the 21st century nurses","Robert M. Joven, information and education services librarian, Lyman Maynard Stowe Library, University of Connecticut Health Centerâ€“Farmington","Objective: This poster will describe the efforts of the library to educate the nurses of the University of Connecticut Health Center in nursing informatics. Turn out for library classes has been low. Among the reasons indicated were staff shortages, too busy, and simply lack of familiarity with the importance and usefulness of these classes. To increase interest, the librarian is now collaborating with different departments in the hospital to encourage the nurses to attend these valuable classes and workshops. Methods: It has been determined that improvement in marketing is urgently needed. The library realized a need to partner with other departments in the hospital to succeed. Several steps have been taken. A librarian assigned as a liaison to the nursing department conducted a series of meetings with several nurse managers on the importance of informatics. The liaison is also partnering with the Continuing Education (CE) Department to encourage the addition of library classes as part of CE classes for the nurses. The librarian is also working hand in hand with Organization & Staff Development to promote these classes. The librarian, the CE department, a member of Organization & Staff Development, and several nurse managers will work together closely to succeed in this venture. Expected results from these efforts include increased interest and awareness in informatics as well as improved attendance in library workshops and classes. Results: As a result of various collaborations, the librarian has been appointed member of several hospital-wide committees Two classes are now offered monthly, and provide nurses 1.2 contact hours per class. Since the project began, there are now twice as many attendees per class. Follow-up surveys are conducted one month after the class to determine improvement in their information-seeking behavior. An overwhelming 98% of respondents said their searching skills have improved tremendously, and they are now aware of the importance of such a skill. Conclusions: The efforts provided a great way for the librarian to meet with other administrators in the hospital. It also provides greater visibility to the library. More importantly, attendance to the classes has doubled. The interest and awareness level has increased."
"Students find power in their palm: personal digital assistants in a clinical rotation","Jeanne Marie Le Ber, education librarian, Education Services; Nancy T. Lombardo, systems librarian; John Bramble, outreach librarian, Outreach Services; Eccles Health Sciences Library; and Christopher Maloney, assistant professor, Pediatrics; University of Utahâ€“Salt Lake City","Objective: The academic health sciences library introduced the use of handheld devices into the third-year medical school curriculum. One important role of the library is to advocate the implementation of current technologies. In order to accomplish this goal, the library partners with academic units to find practical applications for these technologies. This project integrates wireless Palm Tungsten C personal digital assistants (PDAs) into a third-year clinical rotation. Methods: Students are issued a Palm device for a six-week pediatric rotation. Library faculty provide instruction on basic functionality and clinical applications. In weeks one through three, students learn organizational features, installation processes, document conversion, and medically related applications. After the first session, students present and teach the use of clinical applications to their peers. The final sessions are devoted to literature evaluation using evidence-based applications on the device. For example, using the EBM Calculator, students are taught how to analyze journal article statistics and determine the validity of the research. Through this course, students learn the value of new technologies such as handheld devices and continue to develop their critical evaluation skills."
"Continuing education as a catalyst for interprofessional collaboration","Margaret Allen, AHIP, library consultant, Peg Allen Library Consultant, Stratford, WI; Susan Jacobs, health sciences librarian, Bobst Library, New York Universityâ€“New York; June Levy, managing director, Glendale Adventist Medical Center Library, Cinahl Information Systems, Glendale, CA; Susan Pierce, associate professor, Nursing, College of Nursing, Northwestern State University, Shreveport, LA; Diane Pravikoff, director, Research, and professional liaison, Research Committee, Interagency Council on Information Resources for Nursing, Cinahl Information Systems, Glendale, CA; and Annelle Tanner, fetal and infant mortality review coordinator and adjunct professor, Health Care Information Management, Office of Public Health Region 6, Northwestern State University College of Nursing, Alexandria, LA","Objective: The purpose of the 'Evidence-Based Nursing Practice Symposium' held in May 2003 was to bring health science librarians and nurses together to discuss the needs, tools, and solutions for improving nurses' utilization of information resources for evidenced-based practice. The symposium was cosponsored by an MLA section and the Interagency Council on Information Resources for Nursing (ICIRN). Methods: The symposium included: â€¢ Nurses' knowledge-based information needs: invited nurse and librarian speakers â€¢ Tools for evidence-based nursing practice: choice of breakout sessions on searching, systematic reviews, and electronic resources including personal digital assistant (PDAs). â€¢ What works: new directions for facilitating evidence- based nursing practice: six contributed papers from clinical and academic settings â€¢ Electronic posters â€¢ Small group discussion/reports regarding issues and recommendations The program was evaluated using the following tools: 1. Modified satisfaction form based on standard MLA and nursing evaluation forms. 2. Posttest for identifying program strengths and setting objectives, action goals for follow-up in participants' organizations. 3. Six-month follow-up survey. The poster will feature the evaluation results: did this continuing education make a difference? Members of the planning committee from ICIRN are continuing to work to offer similar programs at future library and nursing meetings. Results: Participants included sixty-six paid registrations for librarians and nurses, plus complimentary registrations including most of the fifteen presenters. While there were considerably more librarians than nurses, all of the discussion groups included nurses. Evaluations completed by forty-nine librarians and nine nurses on the day of the symposium indicated high satisfaction with the symposium content. Participants identified specific ways that they planned to incorporate learning into their professional practice. The follow-up survey was completed by twenty-six librarians and one nurse. The greatest reported changes were in the areas of increased utilization of electronic resources and improved searching. Conclusions: Continuing education can be a catalyst for change. Similar programs should be offered in conjunction with national nursing conferences, as well as local conferences with a well-defined plan for marketing to both audiences. Future offerings and follow-up should be more focused on the content identified in participants' plans for change."
"Clinical librarianship in an internal medicine residency program: answering clinical questions to support patient care","Laurie J. Schwing, librarian, Library Services, and Elizabeth Coldsmith, AHIP, librarian, Library Services, PinnacleHealth System, Harrisburg, PA","Objective: The poster will illustrate a relatively new, collaborative approach to residency education and patient care by having a librarian attend morning report. The librarian functions outside the traditional library environment and provides real-time reference services while demonstrating search and retrieval skills. Methods: A questionnaire will assess the attitudes of faculty and residents regarding the involvement of a librarian in morning report. Queries will be made as to whether the collaboration improves patient care, affects clinical decision making, enhances access to information, and teaches about information resources and the capabilities of a medical librarian. A model has been put into practice whereby the librarian uses a networked laptop to retrieve answers to clinical questions as they arise, and projects the findings onto a screen using an LCD projector, thereby providing relevant information at the highest possible level of evidence. Under the guidance of the program director, the librarian becomes an integral part of the patient care team during morning report. Being present for the discussion of the case from chief complaint to history/physical to viewing CT scan films is the ultimate reference interview. Combining the librarian's research skills with the medical knowledge of residents and faculty achieves an informed, updated approach to patient care and may help to avoid medical errors. Residents are able to access resources demonstrated during report from a specific intranet page where citations or appropriate hyperlinks are placed by noontime the same day. Results: Twenty-six internal medicine residents completed a Likert scale survey after 18 months of having a librarian attend morning report weekly. Two broad categories of measurement included in the survey were 'Information Behavior' and 'Librarians and Information'; these were not labeled on the survey so as not to influence answers to the questions. As to information behavior of residents, 82% of residents had clinical questions 3 or more times weekly and 83% of that group pursued answers frequently. Seventy percent found answers to their questions. Of those answers found, 58% influenced patient care decisions 'much' or 'a great deal' (the two highest levels offered on the Likert scale). We found that only 40% of the residents used online clinical tools and databases including PDA resources to answer their questions (excluding the open Web). With regard to librarians, 40% of this group of residents asked librarians for help frequently and 86% found librarians to be 'very helpful' (the highest level on the Likert scale) in general. Ninety-one percent thought that librarians are 'available & accessible'. The most pronounced results occurred in the questions about a librarian attending morning report. Seventy-five percent reported that a librarian at morning report influenced their opinion about librarians. Even more residents (85%) concluded that a librarian being at morning report improved accessibility to library services. And finally, all said that librarian attendance at morning report had a positive effect on learning. Conclusion: Librarian attendance at morning report in this residency program will continue indefinitely. Computer/ projection equipment has been permanently installed for easy display of search results. The librarian maintains a nonintrusive but helpful presence. Residents have identified numerous creative possibilities for the future in working with librarians."
"Regional Medical Library funding fuels consumer health initiatives","Mary Henning, Wyoming liaison, National Network of Libraries of Medicine, MidContinental Region, University of Wyoming Librariesâ€“Laramie, and Siobhan Champ- Blackwell, Inner City and Minority Health Liaison, National Network of Libraries of Medicine, MidContinental Region, Creighton University Health Sciences Library, Omaha, NE","Objective: Three public libraries have formed collaborations with various health institutions in order to increase access to health information by minority populations. This poster will analyze the effectiveness of the projects in order to come up with recommendations for other public libraries looking at similar collaborations. Methods: Funding was awarded to public libraries to aid in the development of consumer health projects targeting minority populations. Each of the libraries performed needs assessments of their patrons and developed outreach activities that met the needs extrapolated from the assessments. The strategies employed by the public libraries will be reviewed in order to formulate a basic model. Results: Denver Public Library (DPL) partnered with Denver Healthy People 2010 to develop an extensive outreach plan to residents living in the low-economic enterprise communities. The partnership has allowed the library to develop a broad model of assessment, outreach and evaluation that utilizes a Web page to deliver health information to the target communities as part of its strategy. Boulder Public Library and Park City Library developed narrower outreach goals, and their models are accordingly more focused on their specific communities. A final model of outreach includes pieces from all three programs, with the broader DPL model serving as the basic structure. Conclusions: The key to effective outreach is to develop a plan that includes assessment of the community needs and involvement of the community from the start. It also requires ongoing evaluation and fine-tuning of the outreach model. Lessons learned can be documented and shared to increase success of future outreach."
"'This book changed my life': outcomes-based evaluation in a community health library","Christine W. Allen, coordinator, Community Health Library, Munson Medical Center, Traverse City, MI","Objective: To determine the impact the services of the Community Health Library has on users and to see if the library is fulfilling its mission. Focus of the study will be on the reference interaction. Methods: This study follows an outcomes-based evaluation model developed by Durrence and Pettigrew (www.si.umich.edu/libhelp/toolkit/). Focus groups and personal interviews were conducted. Results: Interviews and focus group transcripts were analyzed and coded. Five major outcomes emerged from the data: (A) The Community Health Library allows consumers to overcome barriers to finding and using consumer health information. (B) The service ethic and personality of the library staff are important in creating an atmosphere of trust and confidence among library patrons. (C) The Community Health Library's access to a broad range of current, high-quality, and credible health information is valued by library patrons. They value that materials are available in lay language that a consumer cdan understand. (D) Patrons use information received through services of the Community Health Library to make lifestyle changes related to their wellness, and make informed decisions regarding their health care. (E) Information and knowledge gained by health consumers enables them to create social networks and contribute to sharing with others. Conclusions: The data collected show the Community Health Library does fulfill its mission and that the services offered provide a benefit to the people who use them. The data and stories we collected show that many physicians remain removed from the consumer's information-seeking process, and this concerns consumers. This demonstrates we have more work to do in outreach and education to the physicians about what the Community Health Library does and how consumer health information can add to the physician-patient interaction. One final conclusion that emerged as an overall theme from study participants is that these individuals feel it is their personal responsibility to be informed to make decisions about their health. They want to be actively involved consumers, working in collaboration with their physicians to direct their care."
"Empowering health information consumers through local public libraries","Sally M. Patrick, project director, Utah Consumer Health Information Initiative, and John C. Bramble, outreach librarian, Outreach Department, Spencer S. Eccles Health Sciences Library, University of Utahâ€“Salt Lake City","Objective: The objective of this project is to create a supportive environment for statewide public libraries and librarians, so that they can, in turn, provide top quality, unbiased consumer health information to all citizens. In leading this initiative to expand its outreach mission, an academic health sciences library intends to create a successful national model of access to consumer health information through public libraries. Methods: The medium-sized academic health sciences library is collaborating with rural and urban public libraries throughout this state, the state library, public health practitioners, and other health-related community organizations. While this state is primarily rural, it has sophisticated Internet connectivity and is developing telehealth partnerships. Resources for this project are funded by a one- year Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) competitive grant. Other support includes the full resources of this academic health sciences library, a National Network of Libraries of Medicine, Regional Medical Library (RML) and the extensive Internet resources of the National Library of Medicine and numerous other government and academic online services. This state-wide multi-phase consumer health information initiative consists of forming partnerships to create programs and services to fill assessed needs, evaluate successes, and develop sustainable programs to ensure public access to authoritative consumer health information. Within the first four months of the project, the outreach staff of the academic health sciences library has visited a quarter of the seventy-one public library districts in the state. Needs assessments have been conducted, partnerships have been formed, and consumer health information training has been well received."
"EMPOWER the people: rural public libraries and academic outreach supercharge electronic health information access","Ann Duesing, outreach librarian, Health Sciences Library, University of Virginiaâ€“Wise","Purpose (Objective): This poster describes an NN/LM-funded academic library outreach project in which managers from nine rural public libraries and community volunteers are provided training in access and use of electronic health information resources. The project expands from a cancer information project funded earlier by NN/LM. Expanded health information resources include conditions of particular concern to this rural area. Brief Description (Methods): An outreach librarian and community cancer resource director with input from two community focus groups determined the format for a consumer health information page. The Web page includes specific health conditions with direct links to MedlinePlus. The page also incorporates other meta sites including the state health department and state guide to resources for seniors. Training was provided for the nine regional library managers who then trained their staff. Consumer workshops were provided at each public library site and community volunteers were selected. Four laptop computers and projectors, funded through the project, are used with a PowerPoint presentation developed by the outreach librarian, public library managers and volunteers. The volunteers give presentations to community groups, informing them about the available health resources found online through their public library that will empower their rural communities to access quality health information. Results: The Outreach Consumer Health Web page with MedlinePlus resources was incorporated into the regional public library Web page Electronic Resources and utilized as the direct connection to health information for reference services and patron searching. Community members were informed about quality health information access through workshops and community volunteer presentations. Conclusion: A significant need for training in access and utilization of quality health information was met for nine public library branch managers and sixty staff. If even half of the regional library system 83,940 registered borrowers are reached over time, this will be a significant step toward providing much needed health information access."
"Sharing the power: adopting a grade school library","Mary E. Helms, AHIP, associate director, Library Resources & Technology; Stuart Dayton, head, Learning Resources Center/Sievers Facility; Teresa Hartman, head, Education; and Sheryl WIlliams, head, Serials; McGoogan Library of Medicine, University of Nebraska Medical Centerâ€“Omaha","Objective: The University of Nebraska Medical Center has a long-standing tradition of service to the local community. Employees are encouraged to participate in community outreach activities through various volunteer programs. One such program is Adopt-A-School. Through this program, the McGoogan Library of Medicine has chosen to 'adopt' the library at Fontenelle Elementary in the Omaha Public School District. One of the largest grade schools in the district, Fontenelle student population has a large percentage of minority and low-income students. Method: After meeting with the school librarian and the outreach coordinator at the school, the McGoogan staff saw a great need to help the school by raising money and purchasing books for the library. Through various activities such as book sales, 'coins for candy,' and wrapping gifts at a local store, the McGoogan staff has been able to raise over $1,000 each year, for the past three years to supplement their book budget."
"The role of academic health sciences libraries in the promotion of early literacy: a prescription for success","Shari Clifton, head, Reference & Instructional Services, and Robin Insalaco, reference librarian, Robert M. Bird Health Sciences Library, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Centerâ€“Oklahoma City; Cindy Sharp, outreach librarian, Watson W. Wise Medical Research Library, University of Texas Health Center, Tyler, TX; and Susan Sanders, reference librarian, and Ursula Ellis, reference librarian, Robert M. Bird Health Sciences Library, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Centerâ€“Oklahoma City","Objective: This poster describes the ongoing involvement of two academic health sciences libraries in the support of Reach Out and Read programs on the respective campuses. Methods: Based on an initiative that started in 1989 at Boston City Hospital, the Reach Out and Read program makes early literacy part of pediatric primary care. In support of campus- based Reach Out and Read programs, two academic health sciences libraries organized and implemented successful book drives and public awareness campaigns. Results: This poster reports on the initial collaborative efforts, details plans for future cooperative projects between the libraries and the Reach Out and Read programs, discusses the importance of early literacy and the connection between literacy and health, and provides information about the national Reach Out and Read program. Conclusions: Campus ties between the libraries and clinical activities have been strengthened as well as raising awareness of the importance of early literacy and the role of early intervention."
"The heart of the matter: improving health information access in Rhode Island","Ruthann Gildea, director, Library Services, Library, Butler Hospital, Providence, RI; and Mary Ann Slocomb, AHIP, director, Library Services, Lifespan Libraries, Rhode Island Hospital/Lifespan, Providence, RI","Objective: To contribute to the creation of the virtual 'Library of Rhode Island' through cooperation and the shared use of technology. Methods: This project establishes Rhode Island's first shared online monographic multi-type library information system with the integration of thirteen non-academic Association of Rhode Island Health Sciences Libraries (ARIHSL) libraries into the state's Higher Education Library Information Network (HELIN). HELIN is the consortium of all nine academic institutions in Rhode Island. A grant proposal was prepared and submitted to the Rhode Island Office of Library and Information Services (OLIS). The funds requested would pay one-time expenses for each participating library to become a HELIN Associate Member, for preparing the group's MARC holding records for incorporation into the HELIN database, and for the purchase of scanners. ARIHSL's membership in HELIN will move the state one step closer to realizing its dream of a 'Library of Rhode Island' (LORI) capable of serving a full range of residents' information needs. All Rhode Islanders who need health information will benefit from the collaboration, but especially practicing professional and students in the health sciences. Access to the groups' 15,000 books will be greatly facilitated by inclusion in the HELIN database. At an estimated worth of over $1.5M, the collection is valued for its currency and comprehensive concentration in health-related fields, including pre-clinical science, medicine, surgery, nursing, allied health, health care administration, public health and bioterrorism, behavioral health, and consumer health. HELIN provides a single, stable platform from which all can identify local print and electronic resources available for onsite use or for obtaining via existing interlibrary loan channels or by patron-directed borrowing. Expanded access to a broader collection of materials deliverable in a timely fashion by the OLIS statewide delivery service will improve service quality in LORI libraries and stabilize or decrease ongoing operational costs. In August, 2003, ARISHL was awarded the grant to proceed with this project. Results: Holdings' integration is in progress. Conclusions: Rhode Islanders' access to health information has improved by building on the proven success of HELIN's resource- and integrated library system-sharing consortium and by ARIHSL contributing significant, unique, and much-needed health resources."
"NC Health Info: the first model 'MedlinePlus Goes Local' Website","Christie C. Silbajoris, AHIP, project director; Brian Hilligoss, systems development librarian; and Diana McDuffee, North Carolina Area Health Education Center Library and Information Services Network director; Health Sciences Library, University of North Carolinaâ€“Chapel Hill","Objective: This poster illustrates what NC Health Info, the first model 'MedlinePlus Goes Local' Website, looks like today and describes enhancements planned for the future. Methods: NC Health Info, funded through a subcontract with the National Library of Medicine (NLM), is a Web-based database of local health services Websites directly linked to MedlinePlus health topics. NC Health Info was developed by the Health Sciences Library and School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill in collaboration with NLM. NC Health Info is one model for other states to follow in the provision of local health services information. This poster illustrates key features of the Website including the home and locations pages, the Quick Start option, and examples of pages containing lists of local resources dynamically generated based on user selections. In addition, the poster will describe a planned enhancement called 'Bridges to Health,' which will address the challenge of correctly characterizing and providing access to practitioner Websites when those Websites do not fully describe the services they offer. Results: The partnership formed between the Health Sciences Library, School of Information and Library Science, and NLM resulted in the creation of NC Health Info, the first prototype 'Go Local' companion Website to MedlinePlus. NC Health Info has been successfully implemented, and NLM is replicating the model for other states to follow. Conclusions: We are monitoring user satisfaction through usability testing and user surveys. Some specific measurements include the conceptual understanding of our homepage, effectiveness of navigation, understanding of terminology and effectiveness of cataloging. In addition, we have received favorable comments from users, health care practitioners and librarians concerning the value of the provision of local health services information linked to MedlinePlus, the user interface and the project's ability to help local organizations promote their services. We are tracking the number of Websites linking to NC Health Info and are analyzing Web traffic logs to uncover patterns in the usage of the site."
"The power of improved practice in action: assembling the health information mosaic in Saskatchewan","Janet Bangma, head, Health Sciences Library, University of Saskatchewanâ€“Saskatoon, Canada, and Susan Powelson, library director, Health Sciences Library, Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region, Regina, SK, Canada","Objective: This poster reports on the creation of the Saskatchewan Health Information Resources Partnership. This is a province-wide, government-funded initiative that will provide access to a suite of online information resources to all hospitals and health care practitioners in the province of Saskatchewan at the place and time of need. Methods: Setting/Population: The University of Saskatchewan Health Sciences Library (HSL) is an academic library serving the colleges of medicine, nursing, dentistry, pharmacy and nutrition and the school of physical therapy. Within the project, the HSL is one partner of many that include The Saskatchewan Academic Health Sciences Network, the Saskatchewan Health Libraries Association, the Saskatoon and Regina Qu'Appelle Health Regions, Saskatchewan Institute of Applied Science and Technology, the University of Regina, as well as the government departments of Saskatchewan Health and Saskatchewan Learning. Brief Description: This poster session reports on the process of transforming a serious Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) accreditation issue at the University of Saskatchewan Health Sciences Library (HSL) into a collaborative, province-wide library project. The University of Saskatchewan HSL was cited in the 2002 LCME accreditation report as being under-resourced. This serious deficiency was a significant factor in the University of Saskatchewan College of Medicine's undergraduate program being placed on probation. This project description details the process of taking an accreditation issue that affected a single institution and, by working collaboratively with health libraries province-wide, developing a solution that benefited not only the HSL but all health care practitioners in Saskatchewan."
"Informing neighborhood health* Funded in part by NLM Grant No. 1 G07 LM007978-01","Jeffrey T. Huber, associate professor, School of Library and Information Studies, and Teresa J. Walsh, assistant professor, College of Nursing, Texas Woman's Universityâ€“Houston, and Beatriz Varman, assistant director, Public Services, Reference, Houston Academy of Medicine-Texas Medical Center Library, Houston, TX","Objective: The overall goal of the Informing Neighborhood Health outreach project is to facilitate information access at select faith-based health clinics in Harris County, Texas, that primarily serve the homeless and working poor. Methods: The Informing Neighborhood Health project placed Internet-connected workstations at five faith-based clinics in Harris County, Texas, that primarly serve the homeless and working poor. Each participating clinic hosts clinical rotations for Texas Medical Center educational programs. Project workstations were placed in areas convenient for clinical staff to access. A project Web page was created to faciliate access to relevant electronic health information resources. Training was provided for clinic staff and students completing clinical rotations regarding use of electronic health information resources. Each training session included a pre- and post- session evaluation. Results: Project workstations were used by clinic staff and students completing clinical rotations at each participating community clinic throughout the course of the project. Use of workstations to access electronic health information resources has been integrated into existing workflow processes. Conclusions: Project workstations provide access to electronic health information resources that support the practice of evidence-based health care. As a result of this, faculty members who oversee clinical rotations at clinics participating in this project are incorporating use of these resources into their curriculum. For example, community health nursing faculty have added a library orientation session to cover electronic health information resources available via project workstations prior to the beginning of clinical rotations as well as an assignment whereby students must use project workstations and resources during clinical rotations."
"Collection development through visualization: map library holdings and the community served using graphic information systems","Elizabeth La Rue, AHIP, student, School of Information Science, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA","Objective: Use geographic information systems (GIS) software to map public libraries, surrounding demographics, and library collections to determine if the library holdings serve its community. Methods: After geocoding the public libraries in the City of Chicago, ArcGIS software will be used to create a visual representation of the libraries, their holdings and their surrounding demographics. The City of Chicago will be mapped from TIGER files, supported by the US Census Bureau, and census data will provide demographic information. An informal survey measuring consumer health collections will provide the needed information on the library's holdings. Results: Currently, there exists no resource to compare a public library's physical collection with the community it supports. Using spatial aggregation (county, zip code, and street) and different methods of collecting library holdings enough data will be provided to create maps and demonstrate that GIS can be used by libraries in an effective manner to assist in collection development. Conclusions: The outcomes for this project will be the following: â€¢spatial data analysis of a public library's collection supporting its community â€¢ visual representation of public libraries in the City of Chicago â€¢ visual representation of demographics surrounding the public libraries â€¢ visual representation of consumer health collections in the City of Chicago public libraries â€¢ adaptation of high-level software to create solutions"
"Pathway through the electronic maze","Alice B. Kuller, reference librarian, Health Sciences Library System, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA","Objective: Concurrent with the rapid expansion of electronic resources in our academic health sciences library is the challenge patrons face in deciding which location tools to use to find appropriate online books and journals. We have observed that finding electronic products is not intuitive, and structured guidance from the reference staff needs to be an essential component of our service. Methods: As an academic health sciences library serving six schools of the health sciences and affiliated teaching hospitals, we have a very diverse user population of students (undergraduate, dental, medical, doctoral, and more), physicians, scientists, faculty, research assistants, technicians, and other staff. Our library offers more than 3,300 full-text books and journals, and the large university with which we are affiliated offers several hundred additional titles in fields related to the sciences and health care. Patrons are aware of the Ovid Full Text products, but many stall and seek reference desk assistance when the item needed is not offered through Ovid. The reference librarians are spending increasing amounts of time helping users find their way through the electronic maze that exists beyond Ovid. We plan to develop a Web-based user's guide that will serve as a pathway to the wide array of electronic resources. Our objective is to clarify with a concise and structured document the approaches that can be utilized to find online titles."
"The power of online searching with words, phrases, and MeSH","helen-ann brown, AHIP, information services librarian; Daniel Cleary, head, Information and Access Services; Diana Delgado, information services librarian; and Louise Falzon, information services librarian; Weill Cornell Medical Library, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY","Purpose: The purpose of this poster is to demonstrate an approach for a teaching moment, library-sponsored workshop, or lessons within a semester course that demonstrate that a search strategy using words, phrases and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) in PubMed brings complete retrieval for patient care, education, and research. Context: Information resources continue to appear at exponential rates. PubMed is several hundred journals larger with new print and electronic titles. In 2003 alone, an average of 52,000 citations were added monthly. With the popularity of Google, some searchers have adopted a similar approach to searching PubMed, by throwing words and phrases in one searching box to take advantage of PubMed â€˜s mapping feature. Other searchers may rely only on MeSH. Both methods retrieve relevent citations, but both methods do not retrieve all possible literature. If one only searches with MeSH, the term will be automatically exploded and subheadings can be attached. However citations without MeSH terms (in- process or before a MeSH term was introduced) will not be retrieved. To retrieve a complete range of literature, one should search with words, phrases, and MeSH in PubMed. Population: All searchers that receive instruction in the Weill Cornell Medical Library: faculty, staff, and students of the NewYork Weill Cornell Medical Center, CIMA faculty and staff, and students in LIS624 'Database Searching in the Health Sciences,' Pratt Institute School of Information and Library Science. Setting: Academic health sciences center Intervention: A lesson plan including goals and objectives that will demonstrate the differences in retrieval when searching with words, phrases, and MeSH."
"Using the principles of The Tipping Point to enhance library services","Patricia Vaughn, education librarian; Elaine M. Attridge, clinical and nursing liaison; Gretchen Naisawald Arnold, AHIP, assistant director, Library Operations; Karen Knight, education coordinator; and Kelly Near, outreach librarian; Information Services, Claude Moore Health Sciences Library, University of Virginiaâ€“Charlottesville","Objective: Utilizing the role models identified in Malcolm Gladwell's book, The Tipping Point, and identifying the operating environment of specific user groups within our health system, the University of Virginia Health Sciences Library will develop a methodology with which to evaluate and refine our educational program for specialized services. Methods: Our Library has seen an increased demand for personalized instruction. This trend has encouraged us to evaluate the way we provide our instruction based on context. By identifying each user group within our health system and defining their operating environment, information competencies will be determined. Existing classes may be modified and new ones created to meet these competencies. Classes will then be packaged into clusters and promoted to specific user groups. Contacts will be recorded. Utilizing theories from Gladwell's book, The Tipping Point, we recognize that librarians are natural 'mavens,' and we see an expanded role for our liaisons to act as 'salespeople' in the promotion of these clusters to 'connectors.' Results: The Health Sciences Library: 1. Expanded the liaison program. 2. Created targeted training for specific user groups. 3. Placed new emphasis on user's context. 4. Adopted standardized documentation method based on the subjective, objective, assessment, plan (SOAP) note for retrospective and prospective analysis. Conclusions: We conclude that this is a useful strategy for reaching people who are not regular library users with hopes for creating an epidemic. Further experience with this method will provide additional insights on its effectiveness."
"Delivering distance training to rural health care professionals","Jie Li, AHIP, medical center site coordinator; Judy F. Burnham, AHIP, assistant director, Adminstrative and Regional Services; Justin C. Robertson, AHIP, education coordinator; and Thomas L. Williams Sr., AHIP, director; Biomedical Library, University of South Alabamaâ€“Mobile","Objective: This poster reports on a project that delivers distance training to rural health care professionals. The project focuses on using information technology to provide off-site training on information seeking skills for rural practitioners. Setting/Participants: In forming a partnership with rural hospitals, an academic health sciences library seeks to deliver training on multimedia products to rural health care professionals in addition to face-to-face training. Brief description: Traveling to rural areas to provide training on information-seeking skills to rural health professionals is time consuming and costly. The academic health sciences library uses information technology to package training courses combining PowerPoint slides and video instructions. This poster describes the rationale, course design and development, and information technology and software used in the project. It will also electronically demonstrate the multimedia training products. Results: The multimedia tutorials developed are efficient learning tools for rural health care professionals. Rural health care professionals welcome the distance training modules as they are flexible and can be used asynchronously. It is also a great help for librarians, as it is very difficult to schedule training sessions that everyone can attend. It also has high potential to expand the learning tools to patients and their families. Discussion: Multimedia packaged distance training courses provide a practical alternative to face-to-face training for rural health care professionals. It enables the librarians to provide training without traveling long distances, thus saving time and money. Rural health care professionals may access the modules at a time convenient to them and at a pace suitable to their learning style."
"What is the relationship between eating bananas and searching Ovid MEDLINE? Or, feed them, and they will learn!","Marilyn A. Rosen, biomedical information specialist, Edward G Miner library, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY","Program Objective: Librarians set out to capture and maintain the attention of first-year medical students in their library classes by distributing different foods as focus activities, or icebreakers, at the outset of each class and relating them to the course content. Setting/Participants: The academic health sciences library serves a school of medicine and dentistry, school of nursing, and 690-bed hospital. The librarians teach a section of the 'Mastering Medical Information' (MMI) course for first-year medical students in a series of six hands-on labs as part of a problem-based curriculum. These classes take place in five computer labs. Program: Some instructors used food sporadically in previous years during MMI and observed that offering food increased the students' attention. Why not try this technique as an opener in all classes, using a more organized approach among all instructors? A subcommittee was given the task of relating each food to the content of the lesson for that day, no matter if the food was a Life Saver or Rice Krispies bar. The explanation for the treats was included with the curriculum outlines. Focus activities without food were also an option. Main Results: The instructors found that no matter what their teaching style ( even if they detested ice breakers), these 'food stories' were easy to incorporate. 'Wow' was a common reaction from the students. Librarians, as well as students, had an opportunity to discuss something they had in commonâ€”the food!â€”at the outset. Evaluations were distributed to every student at the end of the MMI sessions, and the food theme was mentioned as a positive feature in a majority of results. Conclusion: Focus activities gave the instructors a chance to think not only about course content, but also about how students learn. These food openers were so successful that the staff has used food focus activities in other library classes and in their hospital outreach sessions."
"MeSH mapping of medical acronyms across selected systems: a comparative study","Mary Shultz, AHIP, assistant health sciences librarian, Library of the Health Sciences-Urbana, University of Illinoisâ€“ Chicago, Urbana, IL","Objective: Given the common use of acronyms in the health sciences, searchers may be entering acronyms rather than full phrases when searching online systems. The purpose of this study is to evaluate how various MEDLINE/Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) interfaces map acronyms to the MeSH vocabulary. Methods: The interfaces to be used in this study include: the PubMed MeSH Browser, the PubMed Automatic Term Mapping feature, the NLM MeSH Browser, the NLM Gateway Find Terms option, and Ovid MEDLINE. Acronyms will be randomly selected from the Dictionary of Medical Acronyms & Abbreviations, 4th edition, by Jablonski. The test data will include fifty acronyms whose related meanings are MeSH terms. Each acronym will be entered into each MEDLINE/ MeSH interface to determine if it actually maps to the corresponding MeSH term. A comparison will be made across the selected interfaces to determine variations in the accuracy of acronym mapping to MeSH. Preliminary tests indicate that differences among interfaces do exist. Results: The results of this study demonstrate that the selected interfaces differ widely in mapping acronyms to MeSH. It was also found that successful mapping of acronyms to MeSH is generally low across all interfaces studied. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the differences in effective mapping between the systems tested. Searchers may receive different results in the different MEDLINE interfaces, even when the same acronym is searched. This finding is important when selecting a search interface and when instructing users."
"New tool for displaying the search results from PubMed as a matrix","Bradley W. Otterson, biomedical librarian, NIH Library, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD","Objective: To identify PubMed searches for which a matrix display of search results will enhance or simplify retrieval analysis using a new tool called PubMatrix. PubMatrix was designed for searching National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases to retrieve, display, and compare records for cDNA microarrays. The tool has potential uses for analyzing the literature for non-gene-type records, such as meta-analyses, evidence-based medicine (EBM), trends, and data mining. Methods: Develop a series of experimental searches and enter them into PubMatrix. The searches are conducted via the PubMed interface to the MEDLINE database. The retrieval from each search is displayed in a matrix that can be visually analyzed, individually queried, and automatically archived. If the tool is useful for non-genetic-type purposes, it will provide a visual and numerical analysis of the retrieval, allowing the searcher to save time and effort while improving service and practice. Searching PubMatrix is available at pubmatrix.grc.nia.nih.gov. It is provided by the National Institute on Aging at the National Institutes of Health. Results: PubMatrix processes the searches and creates a matrix of the results. The matrix is useful for comparing and visualizing non-genetic-type searches that contain simple combinations of terms such as diseases, treatments, outcomes, and dates. PubMatrix can process 100 search strings at one time, but only the search strings with fewer than 65 characters are compared and displayed. This constraint limits the versatility of the system. The data from the matrix can be loaded into Excel for creating different graphics of the retrieval. Conclusions: PubMatrix is a tool that librarians can use to search simple combinations of terms and to present the results in a visual format to their users. Users will find value in the visual presentation of complex data, giving librarians another resource at their command as they focus on providing knowledge, not mere data."
"Reinventing the library orientation as an information fair: a collaborative venture","Carlos I. Rodriguez, medical school liaison; Frank Campbell, health sciences libraries liaison/Web coordinator; Melanie Cedrone, biology and biomedical graduate studies liaison; D'Maris Coffman, IT support specialist; Bentley Jenson, head, Access and Document Delivery Services; Varvara Kountouzi, coordinator, Education and Research Services; Gretchen Kuntz, clinical liaison; Sherry Morgan, school of nursing liaison; Linda Rosenstein, associate director, Information Resources; Anne Seymour, associate director; Biomedical Library; and Rod MacNeil, manager, Customer Services, School of Medicine Information Services; University of Pennsylvaniaâ€“Philadelphia","Objective: Reinvent the library orientation as a fair to: (1) improve student attendance, (2) create awareness of the library resources and services, (3) have a fun event, and (4) create a template for future library orientations. Methods: During orientation week, 150 first-year medical students are given several hours of free time in which they can attend an event, e.g., library orientation, financial aid counseling, etc., of their choice. In the past, many students considered library orientations as boring; therefore, they were poorly attended. To overcome negative student perceptions, the Biomedical Library reinvented the library orientation as a theme-based information fair with a raffle and giveaways. The library collaborated with the Medical School's Office of Student Affairs and Department of Information Technology Services (ITS), to hold its first Information Fair, 'Passport to Information.' The focus was for the students to have fun and learn about the library/ITS resources. Information stations (Destinations) were created to highlight library/ITS resources. Each student received a Passport, which served both as a guide to destinations and as the raffle ticket. The students were free to visit the destinations in any order, get their passports stamped, stay for as long as they wanted, and pick up giveaways. Information fair attendance was determined by doing a head count, and figures were compared with prior library orientation statistics. User satisfaction was evaluated anecdotally by random exit poll questioning, comments written on raffle books, and voluntary comments made by students. Results: Attendance improved from 50% (75 students out of 150) to 99% (148 out of 150 students). After the fair, students asked for resources that had been highlighted at the fair. Students associate the library with people rather than just a place. The planning and implementation of the fair lifted staff morale. A successful template was created for future library fairs. Conclusions: Students prefer a theme-based information fair over a traditional library orientation. However, student attendance at the fair is dependent upon which times the students are free and which events are competing with the fair. Also, a key to successful information fairs is to choose willing and appropriate partners."
"Everyone benefits from clear communication: how can a hospital library be a catalyst for plain language?","Carolyn J. Paul, senior librarian, Access Services; Deborah Jameson, AHIP, librarian; Julia Whelan, AHIP, senior outreach librarian; and Elizabeth Schneider, AHIP, director; Treadwell Library, Massachusetts General Hospitalâ€“Boston","Objective: Plain language is writing and speaking in a clear and effective way. Our goal is to create a self-sustaining plain language training program that benefits both patient and hospital. Clinician use of plain language raises health literacy. Staff use of plain language makes all forms of communication more productive. Methods: Setting/Participants: Large urban teaching hospital. The program is open to all departments and clinics. Program: â€¢ The library director joins with key staff from other areas to bring in a plain language trainer for a series of two-day workshops. There are three levels of training. Each workshop earns twelve contact hours. â€¢ The library and patient education committee plan a daylong event for National Health Literacy Month. â€¢ The library offers a lunchtime working group each month and a Web page with resources â€¢ The hospital and library use the American Medical Association Health Literacy video to create awareness and promote the workshops. Results: Three beginning-level and two advanced-level workshops train 100 staff from diverse disciplines throughout the hospital. The lunchtime working group attracts 8-10 people each month. Projects include the revision of: patient teaching material, consent forms, and translations into other languages. Conclusion: Librarians can be leaders in bringing plain language to their workplace. The library offers a place for people to meet, resources for learning, and a staff with enthusiasm for clear writing and speaking. Above all, the library serves as a catalyst for collaboration among groups."
"Health literacy and consumers: from theory to practice","Michelle Ochillo, NLM associate fellow, Arizona Health Sciences Library, University of Arizonaâ€“Tucson","Objective: The Arizona Health Sciences Library, University of Arizona (AHSL), developed a workshop to educate public health professionals and public librarians on the barriers encountered by patients and consumers when attempting to understand health information provided to them by their health care provider or when searching on the Internet. The workshop includes effective strategies to use to improve health communications to patients and consumers, including using Internet resources that are especially sensitive to health literacy issues. Methods: AHSL is a large academic library located in an urban area of a largely rural state. As a part of the Arizona Turning Point Project, workshops have been conducted throughout the state with the goal of educating and disseminating public health information to health professionals and librarians. Arizona is one of twenty-three states that received funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to strengthen and transform the public health infrastructure in the United States. The goal of Arizona Turning Point Project is to improve the public health system on a community level by providing training and disseminating health information in public and non-public health programs in Arizona. The Health Literacy workshop defines what health literacy is and the barriers and strategies that can improve health communications between providers and consumers. Additional topics address: what populations are likely to have health literacy issues, the impact of health literacy on health care costs, preparing and evaluating patient education materials, and health communication and special populations. The workshop will be presented in all fifteen counties to both public librarians and public health professionals."
"Seize the power: librarian roles in developing and implementing enterprise-wide Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act training","Shelley Bader, AHIP, associate vice president, Educational Resources, and Alexandra Gomes, assistant director, Technology and Curriculum, Himmelfarb Library, George Washington University Medical Center, Washington, DC","Objective: Librarians were charged with the responsibility of designing a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) training program for all medical center staff and students. The program needed to include all key HIPAA issues and be accepted as training by the affiliated covered entities visited by students and residents. Continuing medical education (CME) certification was desired for faculty completing the training. Methods: The associate vice president educational resources, chair of the HIPAA Education Committee, asked the library's assistant director, Technology & Curricular Services to collaborate in developing a web-based HIPAA training module for the medical center. Content was based on materials from an outside legal expert. Special attention was given to clinical scenarios illustrating key issues in HIPAA regulations. The librarians drafted the module, which was reviewed by legal counsel (for accuracy), the School of Medicine & Health Sciences, and the Graduate Medical Education Office. The module was piloted with a student group and revised. The final module with test questions was disseminated using the university's course management tool. A corresponding module was prepared and tested for CME credit. The Graduate Medical Education (GME) Office submitted the module to affiliates and received approval for compliance. Librarians coordinated this mandatory training program with academic units. Results: In Phase 1, over 2,900 people completed HIPAA training. The program was shared with the University for implementation with selected groups (e.g., speech pathology, clinical psychology, student health). Feedback was overwhelmingly positive (scenarios reinforced understanding of HIPAA's impact on clinical practice), though comments expressed dismay about the program's length and legalese. An update about the security rules released later in the year was emailed to all participants and incorporated into the module. Phase 2 focused on training all new students and residents for 2003/04. Phase 3 addresses the need to migrate the module to the university's new course management system. Conclusions: This successful implementation created the opportunity to participate in the development and implementation of a second mandatory clinical training program for the medical center. We were asked to modify and coordinate the dissemination of the hospital's 2004 National Patient Safety Goals training materials for use by medical students and residents."
"The state of eating disorders research publications 1980â€“2000: an empirical analysis","Mary J. Markland, AHIP, Southeast Clinical Campus librarian, Harley E. French Library of the Health Sciences; and Stephen A. Wonderlich, associate chair/professor; James E. Mitchell, chair/professor; Ross D. Crosby, director, Biomedical Statistics & Methodology; and Martina de Zwaan, research scientist; Department of Neuroscience, Neuropsychiatric Research Institute; School of Medicine & Health Sciences, University of North Dakotaâ€“Fargo","Objective: In the following project, a librarian's skill and experience were essential components in evaluating a body of literature. The authors examined the eating disorders literature to answer three questions: what is the quality of eating disorders publications, has the quality of eating disorders publications changed over time, how does the quality of eating disorders literature compare to publications in anxiety. Methods: Faculty and staff from the University of North Dakota Neuroscience Department and the Neuropsychiatric Research Institute collaborated with the clinical campus librarian to develop a strategy for evaluating the eating disorders and anxiety literature. The researchers created a 75- item rating instrument based on the recommendations of the American Psychological Association (APA) Task Force on Statistical Inference. Comprehensive search strategies were developed using PubMed and PsycINFO to identify articles to evaluate. The search results were imported into EndNote. Seven hundred and fifty articles were obtained, and 476 articles met the evaluation criteria. Each article was then read by 2 raters who used the rating instrument and evaluated the article. A rule book was created to assist the raters in answering the rating instrument questions. The raters were blind to author, journal, and author affiliation. The statistical analysis was done using hierarchical log linear analysis. Results: The major results of the evaluation found that eating disorder publications tend to be less methodologically rigorous than anxiety publications in important areas such as structured interviews, random assignment, prospective longitudinal design, and blind outcome assessment. Both the eating disorders and anxiety literature have shown improvement in methodological rigor over the last twenty years. However, the majority of articles in both disciplines do not include many of the APA Task Force on Statistical Inference recommendations such as confidence intervals, clinical significance, a priori power analysis, and alpha constraint. Conclusions: In conclusion, the literature of eating disorders is improving in quality over time as compared to the anxiety literature. Both fields of study need to better utilize the APA Task Force on Statistical Inference recommendations to improve the quality of their publications."
"Development of the INASP Health Links Website, a gateway to more than 600 selected Websites for health professionals, medical library communities, publishers, and nongovernmental organizations in developing and transitional countries","Lenny Rhine, assistant director, Collection Management, Health Science Center Libraries, University of Floridaâ€“ Gainesville","Objective: The objective of the INASP Health Links project is to develop a gateway that assists health professionals and health information workers in developing and transitional countries in utilizing information on the Internet. Use of the gateway facilitates the bridging of the information gap between the 'North' and the 'South.' This poster discusses the development of the gateway including the selection and evaluation criteria used to review potential websites and the design criteria. Methods: The INASP Health Links (www.inasp.info/health/ links/) consists of three sections. Each section has several pages of hyperlinks, arranged alphabetically. Each hyperlink carries a brief description of the site concerned. The three sections are general health resources, specified health resources and library and publishing support and use of ICTs. INASP Health Links is compiled, updated, and maintained by Lenny Rhine, Health Science Center Library, University of Florida. It is monitored by Neil Pakenham-Walsh, manager, INASP Health Programme, and a voluntary Advisory Group coordinated by Christine Wamu Kanyengo, medical librarian at the University of Zambia. Individual pages of INASP Health Links are advised by Subject Expert Advisers. The INASP Health Links sites are selected and evaluated according to criteria adapted from the evaluation questions developed by the Special Advisory Group on Evaluation for BIOME/OMNI, a gateway to Internet resources in the health and life sciences. The first essential criterion is that the site contains information that is relevant for developing and transitional countries. In addition, selected sites must fulfill at least five of the following six criteria: â€¢ Authority: Does the information come from a reliable source? â€¢ Coverage: Does the resource cover the subject adequately? â€¢ Presentation: Is the source professionally presented? Are there any typographical or grammatical errors? â€¢ Currency: Is the information kept up to date? â€¢ Cost: Is the resource free of charge? â€¢ Freedom of use: Can the contents be freely adapted and redistributed to local end users? Conclusions: The INASP Health Links gateway is a useful tool for accessing relevant health information on the Internet. The volume of use in developing and industrialized countries continues to grow."
"Pestilence throughout the ages","Patricia A. Auflick, outreach services librarian, and Andrew A. Padua, student, Arizona Health Sciences Library, University of Arizonaâ€“Tucson","Objective: The purpose of this poster is to look at epidemics throughout history and how public health addressed these events. Methods: History is rife with events that have influenced and shaped our nation and the world such as the loss of 8.5 million lives during World War I (WWI). But these political and historical events often pale in comparison to public health events, which have had a more profound effect. Take for example, the influenza epidemic of 1918â€“1919 that followed on the heels of WWI and cost more than 20 million people their lives. This poster will look at epidemics that have occurred throughout history, the number of people affected and the lives that were lost, and the public health response to these catastrophic events."
"A reusable template for evaluating point-of-care information products","Patricia Weiss Friedman, reference librarian, and Andrea M. Ketchum, reference librarian, Health Sciences Library System, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA","Objective: For evaluation of commercial Web-based point-of- care information products aimed at primary care clinicians, develop a reusable template that enables structured comparison of content, interface, and features and can inform subscription decisions but is independent of any particular product or version. Methods: Based on communication among participating librarians, a working list of point-of-care products of interest and a preliminary list of questions about them were developed. Questionnaire topics included scope, organization, and content development methods; product architecture and interface navigation; potential for integration with other environments; and product niche as perceived by its vendor. Questions were organized into outline format, then refined into a structured interview questionnaire. Interviews, in person or by phone, were conducted with representatives for PDxMD (MDConsult), InfoRetriever, Clineguides (Ovid), and DISEASEDEX (Thomson). Questionnaire structure provided the basis for a product comparison grid that was populated with text as interviews were completed. For at-a-glance comparison in checklist form, an attribute field was added to the grid, interview responses were analyzed into single product attributes, one per row, and attribute presence in each product was indicated by check marks. Results: Just as the questionnaire's modular structure facilitated display of interview data in different formats, it also simplified extraction of a subset of questions to be answered by reference librarians during hands-on product testing. Questions about scope, organization, content development methods, and interface navigation were selected for this phase of testing. Some testers requested question clarification, suggesting that not all questions are equally generalizable to all products, which would hamper their reuse. However, all testers were ultimately able to submit answers. Also, question relevance was not affected by product changes, such as the emergence of Skolar from what had been Clineguides. Conclusions: With its modular structure, the questionnaire template provides a flexible, reusable tool for evaluating point- of-care products. Appropriate question subsets can be extracted for different populations (such as product representatives and reference librarians) and for administration in different circumstances (by interviewer during live encounter and self- administration during hands-on product use)."
"Consumer health information Websites: the state of the art","Andrea Ketchum, special projects librarian, Health Sciences Library System, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA","Purpose: In preparation for redesigning the Health Sciences Library System (HSLS) consumer health information (CHI) Website for the System (HSLS of the University of Pittsburgh, an informal survey of Consumer Health Information Websites was conducted to identify trends in format and content. Subjects/Resources: The first ten returned pages from a Google search for 'university â€˜Consumer Health Information'' produced thirty Websites from sixteen states and three from Canada. These were primarily from academic settings, but included two public libraries and two hospital libraries with formal relationships to universities. A few university CHI sites had ties to commercial entities, such as insurance companies. Government sites were not included in the survey. Methodology: The Websites were analyzed for structure (12 fields) and content (17 fields). Results: The most common Website design was a one-page scrolling list of external and internal links (97%), with contact information (79%) and a last update notice (55%). The least common web sites featured interactive tools (3%), advertisements (6%), and a more complex design, including multiple frames (6%), navigation tabs (6%), tables (12%), and a site map (15%). Medical news and alternative medicine were the most frequently offered specialized subject categories, appearing in twelve (36%) of the Websites. It was most interesting that the majority of the sites were organized by format of information resources such as dictionaries, handouts, journals, and Websites (61%), rather than by subject (39%)."
"PDA power at the bedside: a comparison of the use of 5 Minute Clinical Consult by medical and physician assistant students and residents","Patricia Wilson, associate director, Public Services; Richard Billingsley, coordinator of information and instruction; and Leah Pellegrino, head, Cataloging and Reserves; Himmelfarb Health Sciences Library, The George Washington University, Washington, DC","Objective: To compare personal digital assistant (PDA) use by third- and fourth-year medical students, second-year physician assistant students, and residents in the clinical setting and using the feedback to plan further PDA programs. Methods: The library was investigating PDA resources when a medical education grant was received. The funds were allocated to the PDA Committee to evaluate products using the following criteria: Palm and Personal PC operating systems compatibility, ease of use, depth of information, product cost, and target audience. Skyscape's 5 Minute Clinical Consult (5MCC) was selected for this pilot project. The project focused on residents and students doing clinical rotations. Registration was required to receive the software and loading instructions. Student lists ensured that only the target groups received free software. A short questionnaire was developed to evaluate usage in the clinical setting. The questionnaire, sent via email, provided feedback. Results: Of potential respondents, 43.6% received their complementary copy of 5MCC and had 5 to 7 months to use it. Thirty-eight responses have been received (28 medical students, 9 residents, 1 physician assistant student). Of these, 24 used other medically related software on their PDA. Medical students chose more basic resources while residents selected drug guides and medical calculators. Sixty-seven percent reported using their PDA 'all the time'; 60% reported using PDA software for drug information, 10% for medical calculators, 29% for disease etiology or epidemiology, 26% for diagnosis, and 32% for treatment decisions. Overall, 24% reported using 5MCC on a regular basis. Fifty percent used 5MCC to obtain background information on specific conditions, and 53% to enhance their own knowledge. Eighty- nine percent stated that the software improved their work in clinical/patient care situations. All would recommend 5MCC to others. Conclusions: Data suggest that individuals familiar with PDAs tended to rely more heavily on them as sources for clinical information. Medical and physician assistant students in a clinical setting reported using 5MCC as a source of primary clinical information more frequently than the residents. Usage patterns suggest this is a good choice as a basic clinical information tool for students."
"Forging new relationships: nurses' perception of nursing research in a community hospital, a collaborative project with the nursing department","Robin D. Siegel, AHIP, medical librarian, Medical Library, and Julie Shocksnider, maternal child clinical nurse specialist, Maternal-Child Services, CentraState Healthcare System, Freehold, NJ","Objective: To determine if an educational session will affect nurses' perceptions of the nursing research climate and associated support services in a community non-teaching hospital. Methods: The librarian and the maternal/child clinical nurse specialist at a non-teaching, community hospital collaborated to obtain a grant from the local chapter of Sigma Theta Tau to examine this question. Thirty-one participants attended a sixty- minute, hands-on program taught by a librarian from the National Network of Libraries of Medicine on searching PubMed and MedlinePlus. The population was a convenience sample of registered nurses who work at a 240-bed acute care, non-teaching community hospital. They were given a 17 item nursing research survey before and after the program. The expected outcome was that the educational intervention will show a positive affect on how nurses perceive the nursing research climate. Results: Thirty-one nurse participants attended a one-hour educational session on searching the medical and nursing literature. The seventeen question survey showed a positive change in ten questions from pre to post-survey. Utilizing a paired, two-tailed t-test, the nurses showed a statistically significant change in their perception of the ease of obtaining nursing research findings, their knowledge of how to perform a literature search, and the facility's promotion of nursing research. The educational session showed a positive impact on all questions relating to the library. Conclusions: Working collaboratively, the librarian and a nurse designed a project, obtained a grant, and presented a program that promoted nursing research and library services. Further plans include a follow-up to determine if our participants made any changes in research or library utilization and expansion of this educational opportunity to other nurses."
"PDA medical sources: handheld power bringing information to the point of care or need.","helen-ann brown, AHIP, information services librarian, Weill Cornell Medical Library, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, and Rebecca Levine, practicum student, Weill Cornell Medical College, Pratt Institute Graduate School of Information and Library Science, New York, NY","Context: About eleven million handheld devices have been sold. More than 50% of Canadian physicians under 35 use personal digital assistants (PDAs), and it has been predicted that by 2004, 20% of all physicians will use handhelds for electronic prescribing, ordering and checking laboratory tests, capturing charges and dictating notes. Now and in the future, health care providers carry Palms, Sony Clie, or PocketPcs with clinic schedules, roster of patients with their chief complaints, information resources, and their hospital formulary. Purpose: To provide excellent recommendations of quality handheld hardware and software for librarians in preparation of health care providers asking for guidance, criteria to judge hardware and software and examples of ways to offer PDA access and instruction on using PDAs in our libraries. Method: Create a criteria checklist to judge hardware and software for handheld devices and apply it to these resources. Ask PDA-using health care providers for their recommedations of hardware and software. Search the literature for articles telling of PDAzones, group or individual instruction, and unique ways to apply to patient care. Results: With scrutiny for memory size, screen resolution, battery life, processing time, use of buttons and other keyboard features, and compatibility for downloading, syncing, and beaming, health professionals are purchasing PDA hardware. Health care professionals rely on now almost standard ePocrates or Tarascon Pharmacopeia, Griffiths 5 Minute Clinical Consult, many medical calculators, and information resources like MD Consult and Ovid@Hand at their fingertips. With scrutiny for reliability of contents, ease of use, timeliness, and price, health professionals have chosen to download or purchase those or other software. University of Arizona Health Sciences Library; Bio-Medical Library, University of Minnesota; Tompkins-McCaw Library, Virginia Commonwealth University; the Health Sciences and Human Services Library at the University of Marylandâ€“Baltimore; Duke University; and the Norris Library at the University of Southern California, just to name a few centers, offer support for PDA use from syncing stations, to classes, to purchasing consultations. Conclusion: Over many more wireless networks, PDAs, and future generation handheld devices contribute to improved health by bringing valuable information to the point of care or need."
"The power to practice: development of an opinion database related to scope of practice for New York state registered nurses","Warren G. Hawkes, AHIP, director, Library/Records Management, New York State Nurses Associationâ€“Latham","Objective: To create a database of opinions from government agencies and professional associations that specifically address the parameters of practice for registered nurses in New York state. Methods: The New York State Nurses Association is the professional association for registered nurses in New York. The association receives thousands of queries a year about the RN's ability to perform specific procedures/tasks under the broad law regulating the practice of nursing in New York. A database was created of governmental agency and professional association opinions addressing these scope of practice questions. Utilizing a Lotus Notes interface, documents were scanned in using both OCR and a TIFF format. This process provides full-text search capability, as well as, retrieval of original document images. Regular review and evaluation of opinions is completed to ensure the validity of the database and assure the legality of specific nursing practices."
"Transitioning a successful clinical informationist model from an inpatient to an outpatient setting","Molly Cahall, NLM associate fellow, and Nunzia B. Giuse, AHIP, director, Eskind Biomedical Library, and Dario A. Giuse, associate director/associate professor, Informatics Center/Biomedical Informatics Department; Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN","Objective: To integrate evidence-based medicine into the workflow of clinical teams in an outpatient primary care setting. Setting/Participants/Resources: A large academic biomedical library, an adult outpatient primary care center. Methods: This library has an established successful clinical informationist model that provides evidence-based medicine to nine inpatient units in a university hospital. A previous attempt to transfer the paradigm to an outpatient clinic setting failed largely because of the model's inability to fit within the existing workflow of an outpatient environment that relies heavily on the use of computerized medical informatics systems. This project focuses on a new attempt to facilitate the integration of clinical evidence into outpatient clinic workflow by integrating library services with existing informatics tools. The project consist of three distinct phases: (1) observe environment weekly for three months; (2) in collaboration with the clinicians and informatics center developers, identify a strategy for integration that will fit seamlessly within the team workflow; and (3) pilot the new intervention with one clinic and determine strategies for scalability. Results: Two primary care physicians submitted six clinical questions over four weeks from within patients' electronic health records to the library's message basket via StarPanel, an informatics tool developed for Vanderbilt University Medical Center's Electronic By 2003 (E3) initiative. An established evaluation tool was used to assess physician satisfaction with the librarian's evidence-based responses delivered via this tool. On a ten-point Likert-type scale, the physicians assigned the highest rating to the librarians' performance for adequacy of clinical understanding, relevance of information provided, accuracy of literature interpretation, and effectiveness of the literature review presentations. Both physicians indicated they would strongly recommend the service to others. Conclusions: Use of a message basket system within a previously established computerized medical information system is a successful strategy for delivering evidence-based medicine to adult primary care physicians and integrating medical librarians into outpatient clinic workflow."
"Addressing the needs of the people: developing an educational and administrative Website for a pediatrics department","Sarah T. Wright, clinical pediatrics librarian, Health Sciences Library, University of North Carolinaâ€“Chapel Hill","Objective: A critical role of the clinical pediatrics librarian (CPL) in a large university hospital has been the ongoing development of a teaching Website for the educational needs of the Department of Pediatrics. The Website started with links to a few pediatric resources and has grown to include a myriad of resources, links to subspecialty departmental resources, and departmental administration documents. Methods: When the CPL position was created in 2002, it was stressed by the Pediatric Learning Center Committee that the information and educational needs of the residents and faculty should be addressed. A Website with links to pediatrics and library resources had previously been developed, but it did not progress past a few links. The CPL decided that the further development of this Website would be a critical component of her job description. With residents training at off site facilities, the need for remote access to resources was a must. The librarian met with several key members of the department, including the chief residents, and developed a list of key resources to add to the Website. Not only would the Website serve to meet the educational needs of the residents, but it would also serve as their administrative Website. Results: Key documents, links to conference and on-call schedules, departmental presentations, and rotation information were added to the Website. After this section was completed, the librarian moved on to teaching modules for the residents. Almost every subspecialty in the department had developed a notebook of handouts and articles to be read during the rotation. The librarian took these notebooks and converted them to Web-based modules. The nephrology module has been the test module for usability studies. Data on the use of this module are being collected and will be available at a later date. Conclusions: Developing a departmental Website has been a time-consuming but useful project. Not only do residents and department members use the Website for conference schedules and links to electronic resources, but they also use this site for rotation readings, online lectures, and other useful information."
"Integrating library instruction into an evolving evidence-based pharmacology and pharmacotherapy course with a problem-based learning approach: implementation and assessment","Irena Bond, librarian; Alice Gardner, assistant professor of  pharmocology/toxicology; and Mariana Lapidus, health sciences  librarian, Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciencesâ€“Worcester, MA","Objective: The objectives of this study are to discuss the integration of a library instruction component into an evidence- based pharmacology course with a problem-based approach in a pharmacy school curriculum; to assess students' information literacy, evidence-based medicine, and problem solving skills; and to determine future library instruction implications. Methods: A two-pronged approach aims to prepare pharmacy students to identify and to successfully use the best available evidence by integrating information literacy and problem- solving skills into the clinical pharmacology decision-making process. Problem-based learning is used as a teaching and learning method. Students are separated randomly into small groups and are given one case study per group per week. Case studies are unraveled using evidence-based strategies. Faculty members and librarians serve as facilitators to each group. Multiple print and electronic library resources provide access to additional information. A survey is administered at the beginning and at the end of the course to all participants to assess library instruction outcomes and to determine future library instruction implications. Results: During the ten-week course, fifteen students randomly assigned to four groups, solved four pharmacological cases each using EBM methodology. The professor and the librarians facilitated the groups and individual students during problem-solving and information-seeking sessions. Groups worked as a team and presented their cases and research strategy every two weeks. Pre- and posttests assessing information literacy, evidence-based medicine, and problem- based learning skills demonstrated a significant improvement in each area. Conclusions: As a result of faculty-librarian collaboration, library instruction was successfully integrated into a new pharmaceutical science elective course. The integration of problem-based and evidence-based medicine methodology complemented and enhanced student learning."
"Learning from afar: distance education degree opportunities for the working health sciences paraprofessional","Kathryn J. Skhal, document delivery coordinator, Carlson Health Sciences Library, University of Californiaâ€“Davis","Objective: To explore distance education options for working paraprofessionals by surveying opportunities offered by American Library Association (ALA)â€“accredited library schools in the United States, with an emphasis on those courses relevant to a career in the health sciences. Methods: Health sciences libraries can present great career opportunities, but a master's degree is required for librarian positions. For paraprofessionals interested in advancement, this is a major stumbling block. While they may wish to earn a master's, life's circumstances often prevent them leaving their position and relocating to attend library school. Fortunately, many schools in recent years have capitalized on technology to provide an alternative option: distance education. Programs range from once weekly 'commuter' classes to completely online offerings. This poster presents an assessment of the nationwide opportunities available to provide library assistants with new professional development options. A list of all active library schools was compiled from the ALA list of accredited schools. Distance education offerings for each institution were examined through departmental Web pages and personal communication with administrative staff. Any health sciences course offerings were noted. The literature was also reviewed for qualitative program reviews. Results: While 44.4% of library school curricula include online courses, there are surprisingly few library schools that provide online degrees: only twelve programs can be completed with minimal residency requirements. Satellite sites, held in physically remote locations (29.6%) or via video conferencing (27.8%) are also popular distance education options. Over one third of schools (37.0%) provide no distance options at all. Several schools also offer health science specializations (11.1%) or dual master's degrees (7.4%) relevant to the health sciences. Of the others, most still offer some science course offerings (74.1%). Unfortunately, little literature exists on the online programs currently being offered. What has been published tends to be self-generated and publicity oriented. Publication of objective comparisons of these services would enable potential students to make better informed decisions. Conclusions: There are several quality distance education programs currently offered nationwide. Some offer opportunities specific to the working health paraprofessional. By enrolling in these programs, ambitious library assistants can effectively pursue their career development while maintaining their current position."
"Effects of geographic factors on the education and training of health sciences librarians in the mid-Atlantic states","W. John MacMullen, doctoral student, School of Information and Library Science, University of North Carolinaâ€“Chapel Hill","Objective: Investigate potential relationships between the geographic location of librarians' graduate education and training and their subsequent employment and continuing education. Methods: Web-based survey instruments and online content analysis of MLA and information and library science (ILS) program Websites. Setting/subjects: Approximately 400 health sciences librarians holding the master's or other degrees from 35 Association of Academic Health Sciences Libraries (AAHSL) member libraries in the mid-Atlantic states, ILS program Websites within the same region, and MLA's resource of health sciences librarianship courses in ALA-accredited programs. Results: While there are approximately 400 health sciences librarians working in 35 AAHSL member libraries in the 7 mid-Atlantic states (Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Washington, DC), there are few accredited schools of information and library science in that region that provide coursework and training specifically targeted toward educating current and future health sciences librarians. This study will investigate where librarians in the mid-Atlantic region received their graduate degrees and to what extent geographic factors affected their decisions about where to seek their degrees and employment. Conclusions: In general, the results should help ILS programs understand the potential demand for health sciences libraries instruction and should help libraries understand from where future recruits might be drawn."
"Have mobile videobroadcasting unit, will travel: training librarians to offer 'any place, any time' classes and events via streaming video","Sharon E. Dennis, librarian, Multimedia Development, Spencer S. Eccles Health Sciences Library, University of Utahâ€“Salt Lake City","Objective: The Midcontinental Region (MCR) of the National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NN/LM) sought to offer its members live and archived video streaming events and classes, so that member librarians could view the events regardless of location and time constraints. The mobile videobroadcasting unit was designed so that it could be shipped to resource libraries. Training sessions were held to allow resource libraries to broadcast from their location. Methods: The mobile videobroadcasting unit consists of a computer with high-end video capture card, scan converter, video switcher, and audio equipment. The equipment is bolted to a rack encased in a hard-sided mobile cart commonly used by musicians to ship equipment. A high-end video camera and tripod are shipped separately from the cart. Once at the broadcasting site, the equipment can be assembled for a live broadcast within fifteen minutes. The computer includes software for encoding live video in both Real Media and Windows Media format. The live stream is sent to a server at the Regional Medical Library for broadcast over the Internet. MCR staff conducted training sessions at several resource libraries in advance of live events. The results of the training and regional participation in the events will be presented. Results: Two training sessions were conducted in March and April of 2004. Results from the training sessions will be presented. In addition, a new lighter, smaller mobile videobroadcasting unit has been configured. The new unit will make the technology more accessible to Resource Libraries, as well as being less costly to ship and easier to set up. Conclusions: The mobile videobroadcasting unit offers a unique way to offer distance education opportunities to member libraries by presenting events and classes via streaming video."
"CHARTing local health data: teaching librarians statistical tools for public health research","Helena VonVille, director, Library, School of Public Health, University of Texas Health Science Centerâ€“Houston, and Deborah Halsted, associate director, Public Services & Operations, Houston Academy of Medicine-Texas Medical Center Library, Houston, TX","Objectives: (1) Improve access to local health, demographic, and environmental data in the state of Texas; and (2) instruct librarians on the use of the resources. Methods: A Website was developed that provided access to health-related data, including determinants of health. Four criteria were established for inclusion on this Website to ensure the authoritative nature of the data. To date, the authors have led a pre-conference workshop for the 2003 Texas Library Association Annual Conference and have presented at a regional medical library conference. A collaborative relationship with the Texas Public Health Training Center has also been developed; classes offered in 2004 are marketed through the training center to public health practitioners throughout Texas as well as librarians. The site also serves as the clearinghouse for Workgroup L (health statistics) of the Texas State Strategic Health Partnership. This site has been shared with other schools of public health in Texas. It has also been demonstrated to students and faculty at the University of Texas School of Public Health-Houston. Results: Participants in classes have found the site to be useful as a means of bringing the data together in one place. However, the large amount of information that is provided in a class that is typically just three hours long has been problematic for some attendees. Conclusions: The development of the site has been a welcome addition for many people. It will continue to be updated and classes offered although they will evolve based on evaluations received. An interactive online instructional package will be developed later in the year and marketed through a variety of sources."
"An objective scale to evaluate MEDLINE searches","Russell Smith, librarian, Reference Department, Norris Medical Library, University of Southern Californiaâ€“Los Angeles","Objective: Can an objective scale be developed to evaluate students' performances in searching MEDLINE? Methods: Students were presented with search questions that contained commonalities for the basis of evaluation. Each search strategy required the use of two Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). One MeSH would require at least one explode and/or one subheading. Use of focus, English, and human-only studies were required. Retrieval was structured so that students would have a large enough pool of citations to permit them to identify five relevant citations from the pool. The grading scale assigned 20 points each for the MeSH terms; 10 points for use of explode; 10 points for appropriate use of focus, human, and English-only limits; 5 points for identifying an appropriate subheading; and 5 points for each relevant article. This created a 100-point scale. To pass, students were required to earn a score of at least 70 points. Results: Over a three-year period, average student scores have increased from 85% to 92%. Over the same period of time, percentage of failures has dropped from 13 to 4. Conclusions: An objective scale can be developed to evaluate student performances in MEDLINE."
"Focus on the goal: designing a MEDLINE guide for a digital library","Carol Mita, reference & education services librarian, Reference & Education Services, Countway Library of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA","Objective: This poster presentation describes the steps taken in developing an illustrated guide to Ovid's MEDLINE at a major academic health sciences library. This guide is now available through multiple entry points on the library's Website, creating 'point of care' instruction. Methods: Complexity of technology can create multiple barriers to conducting effective MEDLINE searches for users who are otherwise successful at finding information online. Our library serves a widely distributed academic community that includes affiliates at over seventeen hospitals, research centers, and institutes. As an increasing number of users access our library remotely, we look for ways to provide information and services through our Digital Library. We wanted to develop online MEDLINE instruction that included our institution's customized features and functions in Ovid's interface, such as linking to full-text articles and holdings information in the library catalog. In the process of developing our MEDLINE guide, we discovered the importance of focusing on our goal of providing assistance with known points of confusion, in a format that could be used easily and efficiently at the point of need. Conclusions: The process of producing a concise illustrated guide to Ovid's MEDLINE has provided us with the foundation for future endeavors in creating online teaching guides and tutorials. The poster includes ideas for applying usage data to further analysis and development to effectively assist online users."
"Public services librarian I","Cynthia McClellan, public services librarian I, and Janice Skica, campus library director, Health Sciences Library at Stratford, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jerseyâ€“Stratford","Objective: This poster documents the development and implementation of the 'Library Survival Skills' module, an online, interactive learning tool. Methods: Librarians at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey Health Sciences Library at Stratford will launch this project with students enrolled in a graduate level health professions education program at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. Evidence points to a need for new learning opportunities focusing on fundamentals of information literacy and the role of the library within the institution. In order to reach a diverse clientele, we have designed a 'Library Survival Skills' learning module using WebCT software. Included is a glossary, tutorials, and pertinent Web pages. Students may contact the librarian instructor with questions, which are then archived in an accessible FAQ. An adaptable cybertool will help surmount distance and scheduling challenges. More cognizant and savvy users will be empowered and confident in subsequent resource exploration and utilization. When this occurs, practice will be improved across the board, as all parties avail themselves of this convenient learning tool. Evaluation Methods: A pre- and post-module survey will be automatically administered utilizing the software and analyzed in order to determine the effectiveness of the project. Results: This tool is undergoing active development at present. In-house library evaluation and subsequent retooling of the modules is ongoing, thus we have adjusted the test date. During the weeks of April 5â€“16, the library will release and market the course to a sample group of students enrolled in the university's Psychiatric and Vocational Rehabilitation Programs, as well as to staff within key clinical departments. Measurement data gathered from the pretest and follow-up survey will be presented subsequently. Conclusions: Communicating effectively within the relatively new framework of electronic learning is a challenging but worthwhile endeavor. Providing our constituents with a firm grounding in the basics of library tools, services, and information literacy will encourage the utilization of pertinent resources, increasing the visibility and effectiveness of the library throughout the institution."
"Sharing the power: training consumer health information center volunteers online","Kathleen A. McGraw, information services coordinator, and Jean Blackwell, librarian, User Services, Health Sciences Library, University of North Carolinaâ€“Chapel Hill; Julie Sweedler, manager, Women's Health Information Center, NC Women's Hospital, Chapel Hill, NC; and Mary W. White, graduate assistant, and Angelique Jenks-Brown, graduate student intern, User Services, Health Sciences Library, University of North Carolinaâ€“Chapel Hill","Purpose: This poster will share the process of creating an online tutorial for training volunteers to provide direct customer service in a consumer health information center. Setting/Participants/Resources: The participants of this project were librarians and graduate assistants from a large, academic health sciences library collaborating with a health educator and volunteers from a hospital-based consumer health information center. Brief Description: Consumer health information centers often have limited staff available to provide service to walk-in and telephone customers. One way to address this problem is to recruit volunteers. However, volunteers must be trained to interact professionally with customers. Online training materials allow volunteers to pursue necessary training in a self-directed manner while on a varied schedule. This poster will outline the development of an online volunteer training module from the initial identification of need through implementation. We will explore the process of defining the purpose and goals for volunteer training materials, developing the content of an initial print manual, organizing and adapting the print manual for online access, designing an interface to provide easy navigation of the content, and adding self- assessment tools to ensure that volunteers learn the content. We will describe implementation, evaluation, and plans for revision of the tutorial. The success of this project was dependent on collaboration between the manager and volunteers of the information center and the librarians and graduate students of the affiliated academic health sciences library. Results/Outcome: The initial result of this project is an online tutorial designed to train consumer health information volunteers working in a specific center. The outcome of using this tutorial will be to train the center's volunteers more effectively and efficiently. Effective, efficient training of volunteers will allow the center to pursue additional projects. The tutorial also has potential to be adapted for use in other consumer health information centers and settings. Evaluation Method: Current and new volunteers will evaluate the content of the online tutorial. A library student working as a volunteer will evaluate the usability of the Web interface."
"Utilizing the power of continuous process improvement in technical services","Lisa Palmer, catalog librarian; Barbara Ingrassia, AHIP, associate director, Technical Services; and Jennifer Varney, catalog librarian; Lamar Soutter Library, University of Massachusetts Medical Schoolâ€“Worcester; Penny Glassman, technology coordinator, New England Region, National Network of Libraries of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical Schoolâ€“Shrewsbury; and Elaine Russo Martin, AHIP, director, Library Services, Lamar Soutter Library, University of Massachusetts Medical Schoolâ€“Worcester","Objective: Examine the efficiency of work processes in the Technical Services Department, with the goal of reducing the turnaround time by 50% or more for three specific processes: (1) acquiring books for requestors, (2) implementing serials title changes, and (3) handling of journal issues from receipt to binding. Methods: In summer 2003, the library initiated a Continuous Process Improvement Project. The project's goal is to reduce time and/or save money by examining and improving work processes. The charge for the Technical Services team is to (1) reduce the turnaround time by 50% or more for firm orders from when the book is ordered to when it reaches the requestor; (2) reduce the time it takes by 50% or more to implement a serials title change, which involves staff throughout the library; and (3) reduce the time it takes by 50% or more for a newly received journal issue to reach the shelf and eventually be bound. The team is utilizing value-added flow analysis to examine the processes and will make recommendations to management for changes to be implemented in a pilot project. Results: The team met weekly over four months to identify the specific steps involved in each process, review the time involved in completing each task, analyze whether or not the step added value, and suggest improvements to the process. Team members documented and timed current workflow in spreadsheets and flowcharts. The team proposed a number of procedural changes and initiatives that were accepted by library management for a five-month pilot project, which is now ongoing. Important components of the implementation are establishing procedures for better communication and additional staff training. Conclusions: Value-added flow analysis is a useful tool for continuous process improvement. The library's goal of reducing turnaround time by 50% or more for these three specific processes will be achieved, as demonstrated in the pilot project. Technical Services will be better able to serve its internal and external customers."
"Pathways to Online Information (ePOI): a collaborative project 'one-stop-shopping' for e-resources","Virginia M. Tanji, AHIP, librarian, Library Resource Center; Steven Seifried, associate professor, Cell and Moledular Biology; and Annis Lee Adams, assistant librarian, Library Resource Center; John A. Burns School of Medicine, University of Hawaiiâ€“Manoa, Honolulu, HI; Carolyn Ching, AHIP, reference services coordinator, and Sarah Jansen, reference librarian, Reference Department, Hawaii Medical Libraryâ€“Honolulu; and Paul Wermager, librarian, and Jessica Hashimoto, digital librarian, Science Technology Public Services, Library, University of Hawaiiâ€“Manoa, Honolulu, HI","Objective: ePOI is a Web database for providing a single point of access for electronic biomedical resources owned by Hawaii Medical Library (HML), a subsidiary of Queens Health Systems, and University of Hawaii-Manoa (UHM) Library. In a unique contractual arrangement between John A. Burns School of Medicine (JABSOM) and HML, the students, faculty, staff, researchers, and clinicians of the College of the Health Sciences at UHM, which includes JABSOM, and the Schools of Nursing and Social Work, have access to electronic resources in the biomedical sciences from two major and separately administered collections. HML has a contract with JABSOM to provide access to clinical medical resources while UHM Library supports the basic sciences, nursing, and social work. Many constituencies of each library have access to both resources. Methods: Users and librarians were finding it increasingly difficult to identify quickly what titles were available via each library without checking in several places. The project group envisioned the creation of single access site to electronic resources available from both libraries. The idea led to a collaborative project between JABSOM, HML, and UHM Library funded by a NLM grant under its Internet Access to Digital Libraries program. Title-specific data were compiled by machine and hand from data extracted from LocatorPlus. Holding-specific data were compiled and updated by manual entry and Serial Solutions reports. Results: The project produced the first comprehensive portal of biomedical holdings in Hawaii. Users can search for e- books, e-journals, databases, and Websites available at HML and UHM Library by full title, keywords, and journal title abbreviations or browse alphabetical lists. Once a journal is found, users directly link to the proxy server in the respective library. Initial anecdotal feedback from patrons indicates an enthusiastic reception to ePOI. Librarians of all partner institutions have found the database helpful for locating available e-resources. Conclusions: The ePOI project resulted in a highly successful public-private collaborative endeavor that brought together a variety of partners. Ongoing analysis of Website use statistics will be used to investigate use patterns by the patrons, and provide data required of the librarians for their administrative bodies."
"Improving fill rates at an academic medical library","Ellen N. Sayed, AHIP, information services librarian/ interlibrary loan coordinator, Interlibrary Loan, and Geneva Bush Staggs, AHIP, assistant director, Public Services and Education, University of South Alabamaâ€“Mobile","Purpose: This paper reports on the findings from a review of unfilled interlibrary loan requests to determine why the lending fill rate was decreasing and procedures implemented for improvement. Setting: The Biomedical Library at the University of South Alabama is a resource library in the National Network of Libraries of Medicine. Locally, the library serves the Colleges of Medicine, Nursing, and Allied Health. The Biomedical Library has an extensive journal collection, serving local and regional as well as some national and international information needs. Brief Description: As a resource library, the Biomedical Library is expected to maintain a DOCLINE interlibrary loan lending fill rate of 80%. When the DOCLINE interlibrary loan (ILL) lending fill rate dropped below 80%, and the OCLC fill rate fell below an acceptable level, a review of all unfilled requests for a randomly selected three months was undertaken. Remedial steps and environmental issues are discussed. Results/Outcome: It was determined that requests in the lacking (LAC) category represented 48% of the unfilled requests, while requests from the LAC, not yet received (NYR), cost (CST), and other (OTH) categories combined, represented 88% of the unfilled requests. Unusual circumstances, which may have been additional contributing factors to the low fill rate, were a large shifting project and new staff. Internal training procedures for how to search the online public access catalog (OPAC) and consistent use of ILL codes were considered. Unfilled requests were used to update SERHOLD holdings, which, in turn, were used to update OCLC holdings. With regular updates of SERHOLD, the DOCLINE interlibrary loan lending fill rate improved to 80% and higher. Evaluation Method: Tracking interlibrary loan statistics as reported by OCLC and DOCLINE."
"Empowering interlibrary loan: implementing ILLiad in DOCLINE/Loansome Doc libraries","Joan M. Gregory, AHIP, technical services librarian; Camille M. Salmond, interlibrary loan supervisor; and Amy B. Birks, interlibrary loan specialist; Spencer S. Eccles Health Sciences Library, University of Utahâ€“Salt Lake City","Objective: This poster will document how to setup ILLiad for DOCLINE/Loansome Doc libraries, will pinpoint ILLiad functions/features that do not work well with DOCLINE/ Loansome Doc, and will identify a list of enhancements and changes needed to optimize the interaction between ILLiad and DOCLINE/Loansome Doc for submission to NLM and OCLC. Methods: The experience gained by an academic health sciences library in setting up ILLiad during the past year is documented and supplemented by a survey of other DOCLINE/Loansome Doc libraries implementing and using ILLiad. Results: Solutions to the DOCLINE/Loansome Doc specific challenges of setting up and using ILLiad are presented as well as a list of needed enhancements based on a survey of DOCLINE/Loansome Doc libraries that have implemented ILLiad. Conclusions: ILLiad software is optimized for OCLC, not for DOCLINE/Loansome Doc. Implementation in a DOCLINE/ Loansome Doc library that has never used interlibrary loan management software has many advantages, but there are also challenges to overcome."
"The power of many: development of an collaborative promotion system to market and evaluate electronic resources","Nicola J. Cecchino, electronic resources librarian, and Holly A. Harden, liaison librarian, Welch Medical Library, and David Wright, senior reference specialist, Lilienfeld Library; Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD","Objective: To establish a process by which all departments within an academic health sciences library have a stake in promoting electronic resources. Setting: An academic health sciences library with a distributed user community of over 23,000 providing a large digital collection. Brief Description: Since 1998, over 4,000 electronic resources have been made available to patrons via the digital library. As a result patrons have more access to these resources via their desktops. However, selecting, promoting, and educating patrons about the different resources has been a challenge. Results: A project workflow chart was developed to indicate when and how certain departments/areas of the library were to be involved in the selection, promotion, and evaluation of the product. From determining if trials were needed, to when information and education services were to be involved, to promoting through outreach efforts by liaison librarians, all were indicated in the pathway. Conclusion: While implementation is a challenge, evaluation of the promotion system is ongoing. The increasing reliance on electronic resources by our patrons means that we must continually develop this promotion system, so that we can guide patrons to appropriate resources. An improved system also means that staff time is used more efficiently and effectively. Digital resources must be promoted and carefully managed to improve services to end-users and to achieve best value for money from our investment in these products, systems, and services. Involving all library departments in the process and workflow of electronic resource promotion has enabled a successful collaboration of work among the employees."
"Bringing order to chaos: an Access database for ordering pamphlets and brochures for a large institution","Ruth Volk, librarian, Patient Education Resource Center, Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Michiganâ€“Ann Arbor","Objective/Purpose: The goal of this project is to automate and simplify the brochure ordering process in a large cancer center that distributes hundreds of brochures and pamphlets to patients in various areas of the institution. Methods: Setting: A comprehensive cancer center distributes hundreds of brochures to patients and families. The brochures are stocked separately in various areas of the center. Ordering brochures is a tedious, time-consuming process. In order to prevent inventory shortages and save money and staff time, a librarian created a centralized Access database, consolidating all orders into one monthly report. Brief Description: The database enables specific areas in the cancer center to create a 'standing order' of brochure titles they stock. The orders are combined into one monthly order report that contains the contact information of the brochures' suppliers, the titles, and the quantities to order. A designated secretary does the ordering for all areas of the cancer center. Other reports in the system assist in distribution and follow-up of the orders. Results: The brochure ordering database has streamlined and simplified the brochure ordering process for all areas in the cancer center The database has helped to cut down on staff time needed to order brochures, as well as reduce costs by placing large bulk orders and shipments. Conclusions: Brochures and pamphlets are important formats in consumer health libraries. Automating the ordering process has enabled our institution to ensure that the inventory is fully stocked at all times. In addition, the database has generated great savings of staff time and money."

"Power of partnership: librarians and pediatric nurse educators working together to improve the delivery process for patient education materials","Misa Mi, AHIP, librarian, and Cathy Eames, AHIP, manager, Medical Library, Children's Hospital of Michiganâ€“Detroit","Purpose: The poster will demonstrate an ongoing digital project undertaken to create a Web-based digital collection of handouts delivered as readable education materials for parents and families of pediatric patients. It will illustrate how the medical librarians developed a partnership with pediatric nurse educators in digitizing these materials and making them available in a printable format, 24/7, on the organization's intranet and at off-site pediatric clinics. Setting/Participants/Resources: Children's Hospital of Michigan, one of the eight Detroit Medical Center hospitals located in Detroit, is the only freestanding pediatric hospital in Michigan. The Medical Library provides library resources and services to support pediatric patient care, clinical research, and education programs. The medical librarians have been collaborating with nurse educators in creating a Web-based collection of patient education handouts including surgeries, procedures, discharge, medication instructions, and hospital brochures. Brief Description: The pediatric nurse educators representing different units and departments developed low literacy handouts used as teaching tools for parents and families of pediatric patients. Many existing education handouts lacked a consistent format and were scattered in various locations. The nurse educators collected them and selected useful ones for the digital project. The librarians identified resources for the nurses to use in developing and updating the materials; provided expertise for software program selection, formatting, indexing, and copyright; scanned the materials; and designed a Website of the digital collection. The Web-based digital education handouts can be searched by category, title, and Patient Education Program (PEP) number. The top ten highly used handouts ranked by nurses of each nursing unit are listed separately for easy access. Outcome/Evaluation: The project has centralized the patient education collection and increased its usage among nurses and other health care professionals. Through a Web statistic program and hit counter feature on the Website, the librarians monitor usage and access statistics. To date, comments from nursing staff and other clinicians have been favorable."

Carlson, AHIP, librarian; Beverly Highland, community health advisor; Anna Johnson, community health advisor; Florene Linnen, community health advisor; Virginia Thomas, community health advisor; and Sharon Cash, community health advisor; REACH 2010 College of Nursing, Medical University of South Carolinaâ€“Charleston","Objective: To determine if library instruction and services presented with lay community diabetes education can increase awareness and use of public library diabetes resources by African Americans with diagnosed diabetes, their families, and their friends in two South Carolina counties and help eliminate health disparities related to diabetes by supporting quality diabetes self-management education. Methods: The Learn About Diabetes @ the Library Program integrates library education into community-driven initiatives to provide sustainable diabetes self-education in communities. The program is designed to reach a minimum of 100 African Americans with diagnosed diabetes, their families, and friends. Pre-test, post-test, and follow-up phone surveys evaluate changes in library use, attitudes, diabetes information-seeking behavior, communication with health care providers, and community empowerment. Interventions are facilitated by partnerships with public libraries, community health advisors, and grass-root community organizations. Customized print and Web-based finding guides, posters, pathfinders, bookmarks, Web narratives, and other educational materials provide tailored educational programs. Results: The percentage of REACH library participants who reported looking in libraries for health information rose from 26.1% to 50%, and those looking for diabetes information went from 14.8% to 42.9%. After REACH sessions,78.6% said they would use libraries for health information in the future, and an additional 16.7% said maybe they would. Conclusions: Peer-led, culturally appropriate diabetes education coupled with public library outreach appears to raise awareness and use of library resources for health information."
"Urban health partners: new outreach for improving health-related services to Arab American communities in Michigan","Deborah H. Charbonneau, coordinator, Information Access and Delivery, and principal investigator, Urban Health Partners, and Annette M. Healy, information specialist, Vera P. Shiffman Medical Library, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI","Objective: This poster will report on the experiences of an academic medical library's collaborations with staff at local health departments and community-based organizations for a program titled Urban Health Partners (UHP). UHP's overall goals include developing and delivering onsite training programs for staff at city and county health departments, information and document services, and a Website supporting information needs related to local urban health challenges, particularly those affecting minority and ethnic populations. One of the unique elements of UHP features collaboration with community-based organizations providing health-related services to Arab American communities in Southeastern Michigan. A key objective is to therefore identify and test strategies for improving information and health-related services to this diverse and underserved population. Methods: UHP is funded by the National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NN/LM) to develop culturally relevant information resources and services, onsite training, and document services for health providers serving at-risk communities in Metropolitan Detroit. According to the Arab Community Center for Economic and Social Services (ACCESS), the Metropolitan Detroit area is home to the largest Arab population in North America, and Arab Americans are the third largest and fastest growing minority group in the state of Michigan. In response, the UHP Website features culturally relevant information, including health information in Arabic, connections to National Library of Medicine and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention databases, and links to local service organization partners to empower health providers serving the target audience. Insights into promising or best methods for developing information resources, customized onsite training, and document services for health providers serving Arab Americans will be presented."
"The power of partnerships: bringing medical librarians to the public eye","Cheryl A. Capitani, AHIP, chief librarian, and Laurie J. Schwing, librarian, Library Services, PinnacleHealth System, Harrisburg, PA","Objective: Pinnacle Health System (PHS) and Dauphin County Library System (DCLS) in Harrisburg, PA, embarked on a partnership to be fully implemented by the end of 2002. The plan was to increase public awareness of the specialized medical resources and databases of PHS libraries and to update the print consumer health collection at PHS. The surprising result of this partnership is that it continues to refuel itself and that patrons who realize the availability of resources and librarians come back for more. Methods: One huge county library system and one nonprofit health care conglomerate created a joint venture supported with a Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) grant application. The consumer health 'revolution' had only begun and people were wildly surfing the Web for critical health information. Even highly educated patrons often 'didn't know what they didn't know' about authoritative and reliable Websites and would grab an old Physician's Desk Reference and try to understand highly sophisticated medical terms in researching their own prescriptions. The partnership was intended to improve library service to those persons who have health information needs and was awarded a sizeable LSTA grant. It was selected by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as one of two LSTA projects to showcase to the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) national funding agency. The importance of the project was recognized as providing a link between two types of libraries and addressing a previously unmet library services need. The relationship is working. The combined catalog of four medical libraries has been placed on the Web and linked to the public library system Website. An 'Ask A Medical Librarian' link has been placed on the Website as well. Consumer health materials are now loaned to the public through a quick-request procedure between the health system and public library system. Consumer health resources at the medical libraries are kept updated. And patrons are encouraged to visit one of the medical libraries for personal and private assistance from a librarian. The future includes plans for a new public library adjacent to the campus of one of the health system sites. And, for certain, there will be more and more enlightened health care consumers. Results: Since the full implementation of the partnership between the public library system and the PinnacleHealth System Libraries, forty-one consumer health patron contacts have been made by the medical libraries through referrals or contacts with the public library system. Moreover, the amount of contact between the librarians at each entity continues to increase and numbered approximately thirty substantial interactions during the most recent year. Staffing of public events such as health fairs and presentations has also been done jointly. The Ask A Medical Librarian link on the public library Website was only recently fully implemented and the results of this are anticipated in the coming months. Due to a substantial decrease in the public library funding in Pennsylvania, the Dauphin County Library System has fewer staff hours and funds to dedicate to the partnership but needs reference assistance from health librarians more than ever as their own library hours and staffing has decreased. Conclusions: Attracting the public to medical libraries that are often hospital based or located at a health facility has some barriers that were unanticipated at the outset of this partnership. Now more than ever, we are realizing that the resources and the services must be brought to the consumer at the places with which they are most comfortable and familiar. This outreach will be a cornerstone of future planning between Dauphin County Library System and PinnacleHealth System Libraries."
"Susquehanna Library Cooperative: enhanced resource sharing 2004: digital power + collaborative power = power of improved practice","Tricia Haas, district coordinator, North Central Library District, James V. Brown Library, Williamsport, PA; Michael Heyd, AHIP, director, Learning Resources, Susquehanna Health System, Williamsport, PA; and Claire A. Huntington, Reference librarian, and Susan M. Robishaw, AHIP, assistant director, Health Sciences Libraries, and Britain G. Roth, AHIP, director, Academic Information; Geisinger Health System, Danville, PA","Objective: To demonstrate enhanced, expedited, efficient document delivery among fourteen diverse Susquehanna Library Cooperative (SLC) member libraries using a standardized electronic delivery system (Ariel) Methods: SLC is a unique mixture of academic, medical, public, and special libraries serving 500,000 people in 11 counties in rural central Pennsylvania, established in 1973 to facilitate interlibrary loan (ILL) among members. Academic libraries were early adopters of costly technological equipment designed to improve document delivery. Smaller medical, public, and special libraries could not afford the same equipment, creating barriers to resource sharing, which SLC addressed by successfully seeking grant funds. In 1989, grant funds bought fax machines for 7 libraries, equalizing the ability of members to deliver documents quickly. In 2003, SLC directors concluded that resource sharing would improve significantly if all members could deliver high quality documents using the same electronic platform. SLC received Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) funds to obtain computers, scanners, printers, and Ariel software for the nonacademic libraries. Software and hardware was purchased and installed in the fall of 2003. Results: Anticipated results: a 10% increase in volume, distribution shifted to Ariel electronic delivery: not met. Installations incomplete March 2004. Computers, scanners, printers, software purchased, received, distributed in early December 2003. Ariel training class held. Final installation at some libraries delayed due to heightened Internet security issues, e.g., recent proliferation of hackers, viruses, and worms such as MyDoom, SoBig. Information security specialists and network administrators reluctant to open a port in firewall. Discussions continue weighing the benefits of access versus the potential for security breaches. Conclusions: Member libraries of SLC still expect to demonstrate the power of collaboration, harnessing technology to improve service to their varied clientele. The power exists, but the ongoing issue of network security must be resolved. Potential solutions include: Establish an ASP model for 'store and retrieve' service for Ariel customers and facilitate a Website of successful Ariel implementation configurations and corresponding institutional contacts within NN/LM."
"Camp for all connection *Funded in part by NLM Contract No. N01-LM-1-3515","Jeffrey T. Huber, associate professor, School of Library and Information Studies, and Teresa J. Walsh, assistant professor, College of Nursing, Texas Woman's Universityâ€“Houston, and Beatriz Varman, assistant director, Public Services, Reference, Houston Academy of Medicine-Texas Medical Center Library, Houston, TX","Objective: The overall goal of this outreach project was to facilitate access to electronic health information in the health center located in the main lodge of the Camp For All camp facility. Methods: Camp For All provides barrier free camp experiences for children and adults with chronic illnesses and disabilities. The camp facility is located on 206 acres in Burton, Texas. Each camp session is required to include a health care provider as well as appropriate camp staff. Prior to this project, however, health care providers did not have access to the Internet. For the Camp For All Connection project, three Internet-connected workstations were placed in three distinct areas within the health center in the main lodge of the Camp For All camp facility. A project Web page was developed to facilitate access to relevant electronic health information resources. Training on use of electronic health information resources was provided to senior camp staff and senior summer camp counselors. These individuals in turn acted as trainers for health care providers and remaining summer camp counselors. Site visits and group interviews were conducted throughout the project's duration to evaluate its effectiveness. Results: Project workstations were used throughout the course of the project. Camp staff observed project workstations being used for reference purposes as well. For example, a contract nurse hired to staff the muscular dystrophy camp who was not familiar with muscular dystrophy used the medical dictionary in MedlinePlus to look up terms. Physicians used dermatology images to verify conditions not typically seen in the hospital setting such as bee stings. Pharmacists used drug resources to verify drug interactions and drug levels. Conclusions: The project has proven so popular that project staff have been invited to participate in Camp For All's spring orientation. This orientation session is attended by representatives from every summer camp. Being included in the orientation will allow project staff to describe Camp For All Connection resources firsthand prior to the beginning of the summer camp season."
"Communication paradigms for community outreach, the Allendale study","Dennis A. Pernotto, head, IAIMS/Program Evaluation, Health Sciences Library, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Centerâ€“Shreveport","Objective: The goal of the pilot project is to develop effective communication models among and between participants, to devise education and treatment modalities that address culturally based diabetes, and to impact not only the diabetic patient but the family unit. Methods: Setting/Participants/Resources: Allendale is an inter- city area touching three zip codes. This community has the highest rate of diabetes in the city, which itself has the highest rate in the state. The state is tops in the nation in diabetes deaths (2002). Thirty-two percent of the patients at this medical center reside in this area. Traditional clinical treatment of diabetes produced limited effectiveness in long-term healthy lifestyle choices. To address this problem, stakeholders were enlisted from multiple departments at an academic medical center, a state university, a state university agricultural extension service, and personnel and resources at public libraries, community agencies, faith-based organizations, local, state, and national associations. Goals: to explore/develop culturally appropriate and medically accurate health information models; to encourage community initiatives that promote healthy choices; to enlist health care providers, educators, faith-based and community agencies, and businesses to empower patients to make personal decisions; and to place prevention first by reducing risk factors and complications of chronic diabetes to close the gap in health disparities. Results: As a result of planning meetings among stakeholders and focus groups with patients/families, the project has evolved into a modified longitudinal study with a focus on the interrelation between a patient's self-determination score and that same patient's scores on indicators from treatment procedures. This self-determination test will be given as a pretest to all patients entering the study and will be given at fixed intervals during treatment (e.g., every six months) as a posttest. Conclusions: Preliminary indications based upon the comparison of scores from a self-determination instrument used as a pretest and health measurements of indices such as blood pressure, weight, and hemoglobin levels taken during the first two months of treatment sessions indicate that there is a positive correlation between the two."
"Access to electronic health information in North Central Pennsylvania","Valerie Gross, AHIP, librarian, Academic Information, Community Health Resource Library, and Britain Roth, AHIP, director, Academic Information, Health Sciences Library, Geisinger Health System, Danville, PA","Objective: Community members and public librarians in eleven rural counties were educated to become their own health care advocates, to develop the skills to find trusted health information on the Internet, and to access the professional support of the consumer health library located in a tertiary care center. Methods: Taking advantage of the 'Access to Electronic Health Information' training sessions and instructional material, the participants accessed quality health information on the Internet at their local public library. Two one-day conferences on health information services were held. Forty- five public librarians from the eleven rural county regions were invited to attend the one-day conference. Twelve public libraries in five rural counties were selected to receive online health information access training for their patrons. The targeted libraries were chosen due to availability of computers, perceived need, and willingness of the librarians to be involved. Participants in all classes were asked to complete a Pre-training evaluation, post-training evaluation and three- month post-training evaluation form to gauge the effectiveness of the classes. Results: Three evaluation forms were used to assess the success of the program. The pre-training evaluation form asked participants for their areas of interest. The most popular topics to search were general medicine, women's health, surgery, and medication. The post-training evaluation form was used to assess the effectiveness of the training class. The responses were positive, with all questions answered in the 90th percentile. Three months after the training class, attendees were mailed an evaluation form to ascertain whether they had used what they learned in the training class. Eighty-eight percent responded that they had used what they learned. Conclusions: Community awareness of quality and valid health information via the Internet is steadily increasing in North Central Pennsylvania. Through this ongoing collaborative project, public librarians and public library patrons continue to receive valuable information about finding trusted health resources on the Internet."
"If it's Tuesday, it must be Belgium: the power of an urban circuit rider","Patricia May, AHIP, director, Library Services; Eleanor Silverman, AHIP, medical librarian; and Madeleine Taylor, medical librarian; Health Sciences Library, St. Joseph's Regional Medical Center, Paterson, NJ; and Elaine Brogan, medical librarian, Medical Library & Parent Resource Center, Children's Specialized Hospital, Mountainside, NJ","Objective: The Circuit Rider Librarian Program was designed to satisfy the need for professional library services in area hospitals and to generate revenue for the library. Setting/Methods: The medical center is a 792-bed, tertiary care teaching hospital in an urban setting that is a level 2 trauma center and a 120-bed state designated children's hospital. Within a 20-mile radius, there are many small community hospitals without librarians. The administrator at one of these hospitals approached the former director of the library requesting a formal library services consultation. After submitting her report, the administrator asked, 'Can you deliver these services?' With a positive reply, our program was born. Twenty-three years and 11 hospitals later, the success of the program is attributed to the personal, caring service all library users receive from the circuit librarian and the staff of the home library. The program is self-supporting and the income generated has become part of the library's funding and been used to partially offset recent hospital shortfalls. Results: The circuit rider program is a success due to the customized service that all patrons receive. The circuit librarian is a valued member of each hospital's team and collaborates with administrative staff to tailor services in each client hospital. Unanticipated benefits of the program include the generation of sufficient revenue to self-fund the program, as well as contributing to the collection development, staff educational activities, and capital expenditures of the home library. The home hospital's reputation and standing in the community is enhanced by this outreach service. Conclusion: Circuit librarians do not always travel hundreds of miles. In urban areas, a circuit program can be successful, mainly due to personalized, one-on-one, informal relationships between the librarian and the patrons. A long-term, indispensable partnership with area hospitals can be forged."
"EmPowering the community through wireless outreach","Graciela G. Reyna, circuit librarian, and Debra Warner, AHIP, library director, Medical Library, Regional Academic Health Center, University of Texas Health Science Centerâ€“San Antonio, Harlingen, TX; Mary Jo Dwyer, outreach/reference librarian, Briscoe Library, and Cindy Olney, evaluation specialist, Academic Information Services, The University of Texas Health Science Centerâ€“San Antonio; Andrew Lombardo, assistant librarian, Medical Library, Regional Academic Health Center, University of Texas Health Science Centerâ€“San Antonio, Harlingen, TX; Evelyn Olivier, AHIP, deputy library director and associate director, Public Services, Briscoe Library, University of Texas Health Science Centerâ€“ San Antonio; and Santiago Villanueva, associate regional director, Colonias Program, Center for Housing and Urban Development, Texas A&M Universityâ€“Weslaco","Purpose: Open air wireless access to MedlinePlus enables outreach librarians to enhance outreach to promotores and colonia residents along the Texas Mexico Border with real time (live) demonstrations. Setting/Subjects: Wireless access that introduces colonia residents to NLM Internet resources has a positive impact on their health literacy. Methodology: Observational study using interviews with promotores and colonia residents. Results: Preliminary visit to selected colonia community centers has revealed successful use of a wireless card to introduce NLM products such as MedlinePlus in sites that are still waiting for Internet connectivity. Outreach librarians have successfully trained promotores and community residents both in English and Spanish in five colonias along the Texas- Mexico Border."
"MedlinePlus Go Local in Missouri: a collaborative venture using legacy data","Amanda Lynn McConnell, information services librarian, Information Services, and Caryn Scoville, MA, head, Interlibrary Loan, Interlibrary Loan, J. Otto Lottes Health Sciences Library, University of Missouriâ€“Columbia","Objective: Following in the footsteps of North Carolina's NC Health Info, this poster describes Missouri's progress in developing a Go Local partnership linking Missouri health consumers to local resources from MedlinePlus health topics. Methods: Missouri's approach to developing a Go Local site differed from North Carolina's in that Missouri already had an existing database of community resources. This database houses an amalgam of local and state resources mostly in the education and health and human services domains, utilizes the Alliance and Information Referral Systems (AIRS) taxonomy, and has a philosophy of decentralized control. Groups from multiple disciplines and organizations are collaborating to map the AIRS taxonomy to the MedlinePlus vocabulary, to institute a resource selection and review policy, to update the indexing for accuracy and consistency, and to monitor the recall and precision of search results. Results: An initial mapping between the AIRS taxonomy and MedlinePlus vocabulary has been completed. North Carolina's Local Terms, 'see reference' list, and mapping from the MedlinePlus topics to local terms were utilized. A resource review policy was instated, and a procedure for amending indexing was implemented. Missouri partners are currently involved in improving the indexing. NLM and local partners are also evaluating retrieval for various health topics. In the next phase of the project, the focus will be on selecting additional resources to enrich the comprehensiveness of the database content. Technical enhancements are also planned to improve functionality. Conclusions: The first incarnation of Missouri's Go Local project is scheduled to go live sometime within the next year. The project has proven to be complex and involved mainly due to problems with legacy data and inconsistent indexing, but Missouri Go Local promises to aid consumers in finding pertinent local resources."
"Harnessing and celebrating the publishing energy of your organization","Ellen Justice, medical librarian, Christiana Hospital Library, Christiana Care Health System, Newark, DE","Objective: To uncover, promote, and celebrate the publications of Christiana Care Health System staff and employees. Methods: The health system medical libraries built a database of publications authored by Christiana Care staff and employees. The database is used to help quantify for the Board of Trustees how much publishing and research is being done each year and to promote publishing activities systemwide. In order to start building the database, the publications written by well-known authors were identified. Searches were conducted in CINAHL, MEDLINE, and Journals@Ovid. This initial set of publications was uploaded into Reference Manager. Additional publications were found using searches set up with the Ovid AutoAlert feature. Now, these results are continuously added to the database. As part of systemwide efforts to promote the authors and their publications, lists of references are generated by department, formatted into Web pages, and then posted to the medical libraries' intranet page. Another promotional activity organized by the libraries has been to recognize the authors at an annual Authors' Coffee. In 2003, the libraries also sponsored a panel of speakers who provided expertise on different aspects of the publication process including copyright, getting started, using graphics, and editing. Results: The process of capturing, organizing, and promoting organizational authors' publications developed by the libraries is a successful way to highlight publishing activities. Also, the concerted efforts to highlight organizational publications encourage more authors to alert the libraries to their efforts. Another positive outgrowth is that the librarian generates unique lists of publications that are used in other systemwide efforts to promote research and publishing and to support accreditation efforts. Conclusions: The libraries successfully built a database of more than 800 citations representing publishing activities from authors in diverse departments. The libraries have also been instrumental in encouraging systemwide interest in publishing and research by educating staff about the publications process, celebrating authors' contributions and offering a venue to highlight their efforts."
"Empowering faculty to choose","Laura Abate, electronic resources & instructional librarian; Leah Pellegrino, head, Cataloging and Reserves; Anne Linton, director, Library Services; and Patricia Wilson, associate director, Public Services; Himmelfarb Health Sciences Library, The George Washington University, Washington, DC","Objective: To acquaint faculty with the problems and possible solutions to the scholarly publishing crisis, Himmelfarb librarians initiated an effort to increase awareness of alternative publication venues that exist outside the commercial arena, to encourage faculty to investigate electronic publishing alternatives, and to provide a connection to open access initiatives via Web links, university participation/membership in alternative initiatives, and publicity. Methods: Librarians faced faculty demand for more resources in medicine, science, and technology as budgets remained flat. Librarians confronted educating over 700 faculty about the limitations imposed by copyright, licensing agreements, and journal pricing structures and the potential solutions offered by alternative publishing models. Librarians employed various methods to publicize alternative publishing opportunities. Publicity was generated through email, the library newsletter, and presentations to fellows and residents when George Washington University (GWU) faculty published through open access journals. A Research Day poster was presented after BioMed Central made a presentation at the GWU Medical School. Library staff education ensured staff could knowledgeably answer faculty questions about alternative publishing. Librarians offered opportunities for faculty to learn about copyright, licensing, and pricing; increased access to alternative publishing initiatives via the Web page; and supported university initiatives and redirection of funds to support these initiatives. Results: As evidence of university support for alternative publishing, GWU now participates in four open access initiatives (SPARC, BioOne, BioMed Central, and Public Library of Science) and supports PubMed Central via Web links. Open access publishing is gaining acceptance and interest is growing among GWU faculty. Faculty expresses concern about journal impact factors. Twenty articles have been published by GWU faculty in BioMed Central titles since 1999, and, with some duplication, twenty articles by GWU faculty are represented in PubMed Central. The library provides links from its e-journal page to open access titles and lists them in the library catalog. Conclusions: Informal discussions with librarians show interest in alternative publishing. There was much discussion and many questions on Research Day and following the BioMed Central presentation. Librarians continue to promote and track publications by GWU faculty in alternative publication initiatives. Open access titles must show increased impact factors to maintain growth."
"Faculty publications database: a practical approach to identifying collaborators","Janis F. Brown, AHIP, associate director, Educational Resources; Chris Ewing, information specialist; Melissa L. Just, AHIP, information specialist; Joan Mircheff, KSOMweb manager; David H. Morse, AHIP, associate director, Collection Resources; and Janet L. Nelson, Head, reference section; Norris Medical Library, University of Southern Californiaâ€“Los Angeles","Objective: Develop a faculty publications database to facilitate collaboration among researchers within the university in support of an increased focus on research on the campus. Methods: Through focus group sessions, the Norris Medical Library determined that health sciences researchers at the University of Southern California (USC) have difficulties identifying potential collaborators within the university. As a practical approach to alleviate this problem, the library developed a faculty publications database that represents the research interests and expertise of the faculty. Searches of MEDLINE by author affiliation are used to identify citations authored by over 1,500 USC health sciences faculty members. To develop a more complete database, a Web-based form also is provided for faculty to add citations to other articles, chapters, and books they have authored. After the initial development, the effort to maintain the database is minimal and does not require faculty involvement to gather the data, which at best is a time-consuming process. PubMed data is imported as XML into a MySQL database. PHP connects the database to the Web. The search interface to the database allows for searching by author, title words, keywords, and author affiliation. Restrictions by date range and exact word match also are provided. The search results provide links to abstracts in PubMed that include indication of USC print and online subscriptions to the journal. Results/Conclusions: Throughout the development process we have encountered various obstacles that required resolving before completing the database, such as devising an acceptable institutional search hedge, dealing with PubMed data formats, handling large results sets and other display issues, etc. The database has not been available for a sufficient time to determine its usefulness. Future evaluation will include determining the number of 'hits' to the search page and gathering feedback through an online survey form."
"Library support for scientific writing and publishing","Theresa S. Arndt, head, Outreach Services, and Anna Ercoli Schnitzer, information services librarian, Taubman Medical Library, University of Michiganâ€“Ann Arbor","Objective: Because of recurring questions from clinicians, researchers, graduate students, and health support system staff, we wanted to facilitate identification of appropriate resources to support writing and publishing scientific research and grant writing. Methods: In July 2001, we developed an online guide for patrons and library staff based on frequently asked questions. Print and electronic resources were organized into categories including style manuals, author instructions, journal information (impact factors, abbreviations, publishers, etc.), book chapters/dissertations, copyright, grants, dictionaries, bibliographic management software, and MeSH for author keywords. Based on the popularity of the Webguide, which averaged 184 hits per month in the first four months, we developed a class open to anyone at the university. Using a self-paced, active learning approach, we gave students a series of hands-on exercises based on the guide sections, and, after a brief introduction to each section, they worked independently to find the answers, with two instructors floating to help with any questions. Results: Although we never advertised our Webguide outside of our classes, it has averaged 300 hits per month since July 2001. Nine institutions from 4 different countries have linked to our guide. The associated class has been offered 6 times with a total attendance of 86 people. Evaluations of the class contents and format are consistently positive with many people commenting on the high relevance of this class to their interests. Conclusions: Individuals who engage in scientific writing are not necessarily familiar with the most appropriate and effective information tools for the publishing process. The library can serve a valuable function in supporting these needs."
"Strategy to promote open access scholarly communication at Tampere University Library, Department of Medicine, Finland","Saila M. Huuskonen, assistant librarian, Department of Medicine; A. Anneli Ahtola, library development officer, Main Library; and Leena I. Pesonen, head of department, Department of Medicine; Tampere University Library, Tampere, Finland","Objective: The objective is to explore the medical faculty members' attitudes toward the open access concept and to ascertain how they view the library's role in the scientific communication chain and how they envision that the concept could be best promoted and advanced. Methods: The medical library's case is one part of a wider open access (OA) marketing strategy and awareness campaign at Tampere University Library. In spite of the library's institutional membership in BioMed Central and faculty-wide publicity, the OA publishing has been limited, however even though the faculty members publish approximately 700 refereed articles in foreign publications yearly. For this reason, it was conceived as important to investigate this issue more in depth. The case study involves two focus groups sessions, and the groups consist of researchers representing different medical fields. The purpose is to gain insight into potential differences in attitudes between disciplines. Both groups will also discuss the role the library in the scholarly communication chain and what kind of collaborative efforts could and should be utilized to successfully advance the open access concept. Results: Attitudes toward the OA concept do not vary across disciplines. The researchers consider the rapid referee and publishing process of OA journals as major benefits, and they value the worldwide and equal access and openness of research results. Primary concerns relate to OA journals' missing impact factors, because Finnish research financing and career development are heavily dependent on publishing in high impact factor journals. Furthermore, doubts are voiced regarding OA journals' quality and reviewing principles. Scientific societies should adopt a more active role in promoting the OA concept. Libraries' essential role is seen in information and raising user awareness in all possible ways. Conclusions: OA requires perseverance and a long-term commitment. In this light, the library's OA marketing strategy and awareness campaign is viewed as a successful choice. For the concept to succeed, the libraries' advancement role is important; however, the scientific community's attitudes and behavior are the decisive factors in future developments."
"Teaching intellectual property law concepts: beyond fair use","Sara Anne Hook, AHIP, associate dean and professor, Academic Policies, Procedures and Documentation, Indiana University-Purdue University and School of Informatics, Indiana Universityâ€“Indianapolis","Objective: This poster illustrates how copyright, patent, and trademark law can be taught in a powerful, effective, and engaging manner by using real-world examples and by giving students the opportunity to use the full functionality of the US Copyright Office and the US Patent and Trademark Office Websites. Methods: As part of a graduate informatics course, students were given several real-world assignments that required them to utilize the full functionality of the US Copyright Office and the US Patent and Trademark Office Websites. These assignments required students to search the copyright, trademark and patent databases, register several copyrights and trademarks online, and study the patent prosecution process. The hypothesis is that these assignments not only provide more meaningful student learning, but are also essential in preparing informatics graduates for careers as inventors, researchers, and entrepreneurs. The poster will include examples of actual assignments. The effectiveness of these assignments can be determined by performance on the assignments and on examination questions related to intellectual property law, from student evaluations, and by comparison to student examinations in courses that did not use these assignments. Results: Students enrolled in two different graduate courses (health informatics and legal and business issues in informatics) have completed the patent, trademark, and copyright exercises. Students did very well on all of these assignments, with some students achieving a perfect score. Feedback from students has been very positive. Student performance on the final examination plus end-of-semester student evaluation forms will be available in May and incorporated into the poster presentation. Conclusions: As of mid-semester, the preliminary results indicate that these assignments were effective in giving students a more meaningful view of the importance of intellectual property law in informatics through real-world experiences in using the copyright, trademark, and patent databases and Websites."
"Correcting the literature after scientific misconduct: problems and potential in the biomedical electronic journal and database environments","Ellen B. Marks, director, Shiffman Medical Library, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI","Objective: Funded by the National Institutes of Health, Office of Research Integrity, this study investigated the nature and scope of corrections made to the published biomedical literature affected by scientific misconduct and will make recommendations to the appropriate entities, when warranted, by the results of the study. The poster aims to heighten awareness among medical librarians and to elicit their advice concerning the problems found in databases, electronic journal publications, and citation practices. Additionally, current policies and practices of the major biomedical publishers and database vendors will be summarized. Methods: Our retrospective cohort study (1) identified all Office of Research Integrity (ORI) determinations of scientific misconduct from 1992â€“2001 and selected those individuals with ORI-identified publications containing plagiarism, misrepresentation of data or other information requiring correction, errata, retraction or similar action; (2) conducted searches in the major versions of MEDLINE to determine the extent to which errata and corrigenda are tagged and to characterize the range of the location and content of such postings; (3) described how publishers and vendors identify errata and corrections; (4) described the extent to which subsequent authors cite the problematic publications; and (4) randomly sampled the citations to the problem articles and conducted content analyses to determine the nature of the reference to the problem publication."
"Empowering scholarly communication through the open access movement: a historical perspective","Hanna Kwasik, AHIP, serials librarian, and Pauline O. Fulda, AHIP, associate director, Library, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Centerâ€“New Orleans","Objective: The authors will review and synthesize the literature about the open access movement in order to identify developments, trends, and forecasts for this new publishing model. The time line will promote and increase awareness about the necessity, value, and importance of the open access publishing model in scholarly communication. Methods: Through a systematic literature review process the authors will identify relevant works on the open access movement. Major bibliographic databases for library and information sciences, as well as other appropriate databases and Websites will be searched. The text of such papers and resources will be reviewed to create a time line, highlighting national and international milestones, current status, regulations, successes, failures, and the individuals who have influenced the movement. Results: The authors' review validates the extensive coverage and ongoing discussion in scientific communities, literature, and on the Internet regarding open access and scholarly communication. The open access movement is supported and advanced by a spectrum of interest groups and activities such as national and international organizations, publishers, individuals, and many special events. Conclusions: While open access is gaining strength and popularity as the new model for dissemination of information, there are still many issues not completely resolved such as pricing models, peer reviewing, indexing and impact factors, archiving, and the stability of this new publishing model for scientific literature. The open access movement has had a tremendous worldwide impact and involves not only the academic and publishing communities but also many other disciplines. The authors' observation leads to the conclusion that open access will continue to evolve and will allow academic institutions to reduce overall costs while expanding the distribution of scientific information."
"Power in your people: applying the experiences of BioMed Central authors to change in scholarly publishing","Mary E. Youngkin, head, Public Services, and Jeanne Marie Le Ber, education services librarian, Spencer S. Eccles Health Sciences Library, and Margaret M. Landesman, head, Collection Development, J. Willard Marriott Library; University of Utahâ€“Salt Lake City","Objective: To support changes in scholarly communication, the medical and main campus libraries underwrote a university membership to BioMed Central/Faculty of 1000 in 2001. Faculty members could then publish/participate without fees. This poster's objective is to formalize and report local authors' experiences, offer insights toward the transition to open access models of publishing, and identify possible new roles for libraries. Methods: The library will combine surveys and a focus group to answer such questions as: Why did you choose to publish with BioMed Central? How satisfied were you with the experience? What problems or barriers exist to future publication in open access journals? Would you recommend this mode of publication to colleagues and students? Can you identify any new roles for libraries and librarians in this new publishing model? Results: Results and conclusions will be presented at the meeting."
"The power of new publishing possibilities: promotion of open access publishing","Jane L. Blumenthal, AHIP, director, and Marcus A. Banks, AHIP, associate fellow, Dahlgren Memorial Library, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC","Objective: Under the auspices of the university's Digital Library Steering Committee, we sought to educate faculty members about the pricing crisis facing scholarly journals and to encourage the alternative of publishing in open access peer- reviewed journals. This effort began within the medical center, and extended across campus throughout the course of the 2003/04 academic year. Methods: To raise awareness and facilitate submissions to open access journals, the medical library paid for an institutional membership to BioMed Central. For National Medical Librarians Month, we held a brown bag luncheon about open access publishing and created a Web page of relevant resources. Working with the medical center's communications department, we placed articles in the newsletter throughout the year about licensing, cost increases, publication of Public Library of Science Biology, and other relevant issues. We met with the medical center leadership and made presentations to faculty committees on the library, and research. We also held personal conversations with key faculty members to ascertain their perspectives regarding open access publishing. This outreach to medical center faculty served as the foundation for campuswide efforts designed to culminate in a symposium focusing on open access publishing in the fall of 2004. Results: From its initial focus on open access publishing, this project evolved into a broader focus on scholarly communication. A campuswide Task Force on Scholarly Communicationâ€”comprised of representatives from the medical, university, science, and law librariesâ€”drafted a white paper that delineated numerous facets of the challenges and possibilities presented by new means of scholarly communication. This paper was targeted to the concerns of faculty regarding tenure and promotion, and coordinated with the effort to construct a campuswide digital library. It will serve as the background for a campus conference about scholarly communication in the fall of 2004. Conclusions: While it is too early for us to draw definitive conclusions, this effort has engaged the attention of some faculty members. We hope over time to generate interest in a core group of faculty who will become the catalysts in a campuswide exploration of new possibilities for scholarly communication."
"The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) Council of Academic Societies (CAS) journal study: implications for scholarly communication in the health sciences","Gary D. Byrd, AHIP, director, Health Sciences Library, University at Buffalo (SUNY), Buffalo, NY, and Shelley A. Bader, AHIP, associate vice president, Educational Resources, Himmelfarb Library, George Washington University Medical Center, Washington, DC","Objective: This research project, jointly supported by the Association of Academic Health Sciences Libraries (AAHSL) and the Association of American Medical Colleges' (AAMC) Council of Academic Societies (CAS), has the goal of analyzing the publishing policies and economic impact of the journals published by or for CAS member societies. Methods: Using the data-gathering efforts of staff in AAHSL member libraries and temporary staff hired by AAMC, detailed information has been collected about some 111 journals published by or for CAS member societies (75 of the 104 member societies publish or sponsor journals). The database includes over 50 data elements about the most recent 5 years for each journal published, in the following categories: bibliographic, policy (e.g., licensing, archiving, author misconduct, article retractions), electronic version, pricing, ISI impact factor, and subscriptions data. These data reside in a secure Web-accessible database maintained at the University at Buffalo (SUNY). In addition to the data gathered from public sources (journal issues, Websites, and databases), each CAS member society has been asked to verify and provide additional data to complete the database. An advisory committee for the project including AAHSL librarians, CAS journal editors and publishers, an economist, and AAMC staff met in early March to review the project goals and data and to suggest additional data gathering, analyses and reports. Results: The poster summarizes the statistics and policy data collected for these academic health sciences society journals as of May 2004. It also outlines the additional research objectives formulated for the project by the advisory committee. These include understanding each society's publishing objectives, publishing practices, measures of journal success, sources of journal financial support, as well as editorial and marketing objectives. Conclusions: This research has been strongly supported by AAMC and CAS, because they recognize that journals published by academic societies face uncertain economic times caused by competition from commercial publishers and pressure to move to untested online open-access publishing models. These research results should also help health sciences libraries understand and support our academic society partners during this transition from paper journal subscriptions to online, more open access publishing."
"The power of community: evaluating HLIB-NW, a regional discussion list","Maryanne P. Blake, education/communications coordinator, National Network of Libraries of Medicine, Pacific Northwest Region, University of Washingtonâ€“Seattle","Objective: A literature search reveals that there are few studies evaluating discussion lists. Since 1993, HLIB-NW has been an active electronic discussion list in the Pacific Northwest. Is HLIB-NW an effective tool for building community among health sciences librarians and for serving those interested in health information and health sciences libraries in the Pacific Northwest? Method: An online satisfaction survey will be conducted for HLIB-NW subscribers. A Web-based survey for non-HLIB- NW members in the region will also be conducted. Interviews with several HLIB-NW members will be conducted on the phone. Additionally, historical descriptive data from the discussion list archives and records will be analyzed. Results of the surveys, the interviews and the archive analysis will help to understand why this discussion list has remained active for more than ten years and what improvements can be made. Results: Survey results, interview comments, and statistics show HLIB-NW is an effective tool for serving its members. and it builds community among them. Of survey respondents, 90.2% said HLIB-NW is relevant to their work and 62.7% said they used it to communicate with colleagues. All respondents found it either very valuable (48%) or somewhat valuable (52%). Considered most useful was getting opinions and ideas from colleagues (70.9%), help with difficult interlibrary loans (35%), and difficult reference questions (50.5%), activities needing communication between colleagues. Interview comments support these findings, 'this is my lifeline to other librarians,' 'useful portion of HLIB for me is having access to other professional librarians at my fingertips,' and 'I learn a lot from the conversations other librarians have on the list.' Suggestions were also solicited to improve the list, among them 'it's great as it is, don't change' and 'make people use the subject line more effectively.' One comment on the survey was 'not too many messages.' This is supported by the statistics in 2003 showing an average of seventeen messages per week. Conclusion: The HLIB-NW discussion list is an effective tool for serving its subscribers and building community among the group. Characteristics of the subscribers may influence the success of the list."
"Strengthening professionals: a chapter-level formative evaluation of the MLA mentoring initiative","Pauline O. Fulda, AHIP, associate director, and Hanna Kwasik, AHIP, serials librarian, Library, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Centerâ€“New Orleans","Objective: The main objective was to determine the extent to which the MLA mentoring initiative was implemented in an MLA chapter and to identify the needs, improvements, and adjustments in mentoring services for the future to improve the practice of librarianship. Methods: The data was collected by administrating an anonymous survey designed by the authors. The majority of questions employed interval levels of measurement using a Likert response scale. Some questions were dichotomous; a few were open-ended. The survey was mailed to all 336 chapter members. A follow-up mailing was also administrated. Using the structured survey, the authors elicited responses to determine the mentoring needs of chapter members, the awareness of available resources, satisfaction with existing services and resources, the needs for the future, and suggestions to meet the needs. The data were analyzed using basic statistical methods, which allowed reporting outcomes in descriptive and graphical forms. Results: â€¢ Out of 335 delivered surveys, 184 were returned, yielding  a return rate of 55%.  â€¢ The majority of responders, 59%, were from academic  libraries, and 27% were from hospital libraries.  â€¢ Eighty percent had a mentor or mentors in their careers, and 74% were either very satisfied or satisfied with the relationship. The majority consider having a mentor a critical part of the professional experience.  â€¢ The mentoring activity, chosen by respondents as the most  important, was the improvement of job performance through skills development.  â€¢ Over 50% were aware of South Central Chapter (SCC)/  MLA's mentoring activities, and less than 50% were aware of MLA's mentoring Website.  Detailed findings will be available in the poster presentation. Conclusions: The rate of response and the wealth of comments provided by responders document the high level of interest in mentoring by medical librarians in the region. The following mentoring services are equally important to SCC members and are deserving of improvement or development at the regional level: â€¢ a formalized mentoring program in the region â€¢ Web-based mentoring resources on the SCC Website â€¢ continuing education course for mentors Members are aware of mentoring activities in the region; however, there is a need to increase participation levels in activities that the South Central Chapter provides."

Koonce, assistant director, Web Team, Eskind Biomedical Library, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN","Objective: To develop and evaluate an educational pathway for recruiting and educating librarians that draws on the strength of a well-established library internship and a long- distance library and information science degree program. Setting/Participants/Resources: A large academic biomedical library and a long-distance library and information science degree program. Description: At a time when a shortage of professional librarians has been identified, there is an opportunity to recruit for medical librarianship from within the pre-professional segment of biomedical libraries. With funding from a national federal agency, this library will create, in collaboration with a library school distance-learning program, a workable model for training that offers an exciting alternative to the traditional librarianship-training paradigm. While in the past much of the training has occurred in the classroom, it has become clear that the breadth and depth necessary to be successful in a biomedical library is often limited by formal curriculum and program constraints. This library will partner its internship program with a long-distance library degree program to provide advanced training for new librarians in the health sciences and biomedical informatics, thus providing a means of applying theory to the work environment. Results: Individuals were selected for participation in this three-phased project based on excellent performance in initial training and high ratings by peers and superiors, as well as commitment to pursuing an advanced degree in librarianship. During phase 1, pre-professionals complete a series of in-depth learning modules designed by experienced librarians and other professionals to equip library informationists with practical skills. The second phase focuses on completion of a fast-track master's of library and information science distance program and practica at the home institution. The project concludes with a library internship for intensive development and application of advanced skills in librarianship, information synthesis, and project management. Conclusions: The tremendous shortage of health sciences information professionals, coupled with an understanding of librarians' dramatically changing roles, demands innovative approaches to recruiting and training. The proposed model meets those requirements with a parallel approach to learning that fully integrates theoretical coursework into a practical work environment."
"Improving performance through an internal internship","Tracie Frederick, electronic resources librarian, Dahlgren Memorial Library, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC","Objective: The purpose of this project was to provide a professional development opportunity for an information services librarian that would make her capable of assisting three library departments in the event of a manager's extended absence. The knowledge of operations and technology gained during this 'internal internship' also helped to improve the librarian's performance of many of her regular work responsibilities. Methods: For ten months, the work of an information services librarian at an academic health sciences library was divided between her regular responsibilities and an 'internal internship' with three library departments. This internship was a combination of an internally developed training program supplemented with two external courses taken online. It began with approval of the internship proposal by the library director and department managers, who then developed objectives and projects for each portion of the experience along with the librarian. The librarian accomplished the objectives by shadowing staff, reading and writing documentation, and completing the projects to learn all aspects of the operations, policies, and procedures of the departments. Gaining proficiency with technology was a focus of this internship; however, online coursework completed during two month-long seminars provided additional education concerning copyright and licensing issues. Results: At the completion of the project, it was intended that the librarian would serve as a backup to managers in each department, if there were an extended absence. However, there were many added benefits that helped her to be more effective in her regular responsibilities and in answering patron questions at the Reference Desk. Although modifications were made to the original plan for the internship, the goal of the project was still accomplished and lessons from the experience were considered in the planning of an NLM fellow's training. Conclusions: Because of the professional development rewards and benefits gained for the library, this is a worthwhile experience for librarians and staff working within a library that has the flexibility to arrange this type of experience.

"Power of history, power of words","Diane McKenzie, AHIP, collection development librarian, Health Sciences Library, University of North Carolinaâ€“Chapel Hill, and Marlyse Hickman MacDonald, information & education services librarian, Duke University Medical Center Library, Duke University, Durham, NC","Objective: The mission of the Medical Library Association Oral History Project is to document, preserve, and promote the history of the association and of the profession using interviews and oral history methodologies. The poster objectives are to promote use of the oral history interviews and to encourage participation in the project. Methods: The poster will discuss the MLA Oral History Project and give examples of the type of non-standard and often otherwise unavailable information that can be found in an oral history. Some examples may be presented as oral sound bites. Examples will include both older well known figures such as Gertrude Annan, recent leaders, such as Robert Braude, AHIP, FMLA, and less well-known librarians such as Jean Antes Pelley, AHIP, FMLA. The poster will illustrate the range of qualitative research skills used in conducting, editing, and indexing oral histories. Examples will also illustrate collaboration with other groups. The poster will also show examples of how the interviews collected by the project can be used to support proposals and presentations or form the basis for library or ethnographic research. It will also suggest future approaches to mining and linking the information in oral histories."
"LibQUAL+: the dynamo of quality assessment","Alexa Mayo, AHIP, assistant director/IIS, and Christian Miller, information specialist, Health Sciences and Human Services Library, University of Marylandâ€“Baltimore","Objective: This poster will report on the changes and activities that followed implementation of the 2002 LibQUAL+ survey. Possible future changes will also be discussed. Methods: LibQUAL+ assesses a library's affect of service, access to information, library as place, and personal control. The library's interpretation of the results identified areas for improved service and confirmed areas where the library was already initiating improvement. Survey results indicated the need for more full-text resources, better access to these resources from any location, and improved service desks. The results affirmed that the library was spending its resources wisely in its work already in progress with full-text collections. The Service Desk Improvement Committee was formed in January of 2003 to identify service issues at each of the three service desks and recommend changes. This poster will report on the recommendations."
"The power of current awareness: evaluation of an in-house table of contents service at a health association","Cynthia R. Kahn, manager, and Marian Taliaferro, assistant reference librarian, Reference Center and Archives, Association of American Medical Colleges, Washington, DC","Objective: This poster examines an in-house current awareness or table of contents (TOC) service at a non-profit health association. Setting/Participants/Resources: The Reference Center at the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) is staffed by two full-time librarians and one part-time library technician. Reference Center staff produce a weekly TOC service based on the print journal collection, which is delivered to self-selected association staff each Monday morning. Brief Description: Costs for the service include staff time, photocopy charges, and delivery charges and runs over $5,000 per year. The librarians developed a survey to evaluate staff opinion of the service as well as interest in other delivery methods, such as an electronic service. Small changes were made to the service after the survey, such as splitting it into two services organized by topic, although the format and method of delivery remained unchanged. The electronic delivery method was rejected based on cost and lack of staff interest. A posttest survey will be run eighteen months later (January 2004) to see how these changes affected staff use and opinion of the service.  Results: The pretest survey was conducted in March 2002. The survey elicited the following data: over 66% of staff who chose to receive the TOC weekly service report reading it regularly, 82% find it to be either 'definitely useful' or 'useful,' and 57% report their work would be affected if they did not have access to the service. Comparison data were obtained 2 years later in March 2004. Please note: many fewer staff responded to the follow-up survey, which impacts the validity of the comparison. Nevertheless, over 50% of staff who chose to receive the TOC weekly service report reading it regularly. That number climbs to 93% when combining those who read it regularly and those who read it infrequently (interpreted by most as 'sometimes'). Seventy-three percent find it to be either 'definitely useful' or 'useful,' and 60% report their work would be affected if they did not have access to the service. Conclusion: The TOC service will continue as a print service according to the preferences of the association staff. The original survey, done in 2002, guided the Reference Center staff in making changes to the TOC service. The biggest change was moving from one to two separate services based on subject. Instead of one service with all titles, there are now two professional services: TOC Week and TOC Management. TOC Week covers all subject journals in health care, higher education, and social science. The new service, TOC Management, includes only the business or management titles received by the Reference Center. It was truly the preference of the management/business readers to have this separation. Staff continue to self-select the services to which they subscribe with some choosing to subscribe to both. Since that time, a third service has been added for the administrative assistants on staff. The TOC Admin service is not a self-select service; all administrative assistants automatically receive the TOC Admin once a month. Between all three services, nearly 50% of association staff receive at least one of the TOC services. This is beneficial to the Reference Center, as it increases staff use of the Reference Center collection in print and electronic format."
"Can your library improve its services? You bet your BIPS!","Karla J. Block, AHIP, head, Access and Outreach Services, Bio-Medical Library, University of Minnesotaâ€“Minneapolis","Objective: This poster reports on the creation and activities of an informal service improvement project initiated by library staff. Methods: The Bio-Medical Library offers rich collections and many library services, along with a strong tradition of customer service and teamwork. A shared goal throughout the library is to build upon this tradition by improving services to patrons. Two librarians in Public Services approached other staff with the idea of an informal service improvement committee and were met with enthusiasm. Thus, the grassroots effort 'Bio- Med Improving Public Services,' known as 'BIPS,' was created. Volunteers were solicited from all units and from full- time and student staff. Approximately seventeen people representing several units and all job classes answered the call for volunteers. The committee operates informally and under no charge other than its self-explanatory name. Few formal meetings are held; most work is conducted informally. Staff are encouraged to submit suggestions, from big to small, mundane to exciting. Patron comments are also incorporated. Results: BIPS has yielded promising long-term ideas and practical short-term suggestions. Even before its first meeting, BIPS was involved in several activities to improve library services, including improved exterior signage, a free 'pull and hold' service for books, and installation of suggestion boxes in staff areas. Future plans include activities that might be carried out primarily by BIPS as well as initiatives to be undertaken in collaboration with others in the library, the university libraries, or the Academic Health Center. Such activities include: student employee surveys and/or exit interviews, improved signage and study space, advanced training for students working in the stacks (to improve patron assistance and referrals to resources/ services in the library), and more. Conclusions: Although a more formal customer service initiative is underway in the library, BIPS will continue to operate as an informal mechanism for improving services. It is anticipated that this effort will continue to increase collaboration and creative thinking. The process empowers staff to become more conscious of and actively involved in improving the library's services. A very simple idea for an informal group has proved to be a powerful way to generate ideas for service improvements."
"Connectivity and computer questions, improving practice through question analysis","Kurt Munson, head, User Services; Linda Walton, associate director; Linda O'Dwyer, education librarian; Stephanie Kerns, head, Education Department; and Mark Berendsen, education librarian; Galter Health Sciences Library, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL","Objective: Roughly one third of the questions at the reference desk concern electronic resources, services, or computer help. Increasingly resources are available electronically only, accessible remotely, and require greater technological skills on the part of users. The library needed to gain a better understanding of these questions to improve service both to provide point-of-need assistance and to troubleshoot users' problems. Methods: Staff developed a Microsoft Access database and logged every question received at the desk. Database fields noted the user's affiliation, how the questions was received, the time required to answer the question, and if the reference staff answered the question or referred it to another department. The actual question was entered in a text field. Questions were categorized as connectivity, hardware, printing, or library services. Staff entered every connectivity question received into the database. Data was collected every other month over one year. The data analysis determined which populations present the most connectivity questions, which resource types or services generate the most questions, users' preferred method for seeking assistance, and the most common cause of the user's problem. Further analysis tagged questions to determine each problem's source, i.e., proxy problems or publisher site for example.  Results: Analysis of 440 questions showed 48% involve connecting to resources; 29% involve library services; 13% and 9% entail printing or hardware questions respectively. Further analysis showed 46% of connectivity questions involved electronic journals and 22% related to databases; 38% of the connectivity problems resulted from publisher problems and 22% proxy issues. Conclusions: Better Website based point-of-need assistance should ease connecting to resources especially if publisher site- based problems are indicated. The proxy server needs better maintenance to ensure resources are included. Library services need to be simplified or explained better to users to improve usability."
"Unleashing the power of the reengineered matrix: redefining project management","Nancy G. Burford, resources management librarian, and Heather Goetz, serials and electronic collections coordinator, Medical Sciences Library, Texas A&M Universityâ€“College Station","Objective: Maintenance of an online collection requires a substantially higher level of technical expertise than traditional print collection management activities. The move to 'online only' for nearly a third of our journal subscriptions greatly reduces the workloads of staff responsible for serials check-in, claiming, and binding. These staff, however, lack the skills or expertise necessary for managing electronic resources and their records. At the same time, the bibliographic and electronic resource staff are overwhelmed and need assistance. This poster demonstrates an approach to project management that is effective in an environment where limited technical skill sets are available. Methods: In this situation, it was impossible to continue the customary approach to project management, that of identifying available staff and assigning them to the project. In the past, when specific technical skills or knowledge was required, we often worked in two-person teams, one member with the needed expertise and the other as a helper. We needed a solution to the chasm that existed between available skills and those needed for the project. Our answer was to reengineer the matrix, so that instead of matrixing staff resources to the project, we matrixed elements of the project work to the available staff. We analyzed the work needed, grouped similar project elements together, segmented the bibliographic and complex record management tasks into small groupings, and developed sets of pre-programmed function keys to simplify record management work. Results: Available staff as well as student assistants are quickly trained to work on projects. Productivity is impressive. In a project to add classification to online journals, they edited almost 2,200 bibliographic records in about 60 hours over a period of 3 weeks. Conclusions: Quality control for this approach to project management involves record review by experienced bibliographers. Error rates will be calculated and reported in the poster."
"Questions asked at the virtual and physical reference desk: how do they compare and what do they tell us?","Sandra L. De Groote, AHIP, assistant information services librarian, Information Services, University of Illinoisâ€“Chicago","Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the types of questions asked and the demographic categories of the users of the virtual reference desk versus the physical reference desk. Methods: A health sciences library at a large urban university offers reference services seven days a week in-person and over the phone. Within the last year, a digital reference service was introduced offering both chat and email reference. Faculty, students, staff, and community members may use both services. Over a two-month period, the types of questions asked through traditional (in-person, phone) and digital (email, chat) venues were coded. The types of questions asked through the two reference venues were compared to determine correlations between users' information needs, demographics of the users, and the type of reference service chosen (traditional versus digital). Coded information was entered into a spreadsheet to determine frequency. It is expected that the types of questions asked via traditional reference varied from the types of questions asked via digital reference. Results: The most frequently asked questions were related to library policy and materials held by the library. In-person was the most common way to submit all types of questions, with the exception of citation verification, in-which users were most likely to phone the library. How to find articles on a particular topic was the most common form of question asked by patrons using chat. Questions related to electronic journals and media items were the most common questions asked through email. When patrons phoned the library, the questions were usually related to hours, location, and library services. Conclusions: The results of this study provide insight into the types of questions being asked via digital reference and traditional reference. Although the majority of questions are still asked in person, definite patterns emerged showing that some questions are more likely to be asked in certain venues. This information will prove useful when training staff, developing help guides, and providing instruction."
"Seeing is believing: using video to assess instruction librarians","Marilyn H. Steinberg, head, Reference and Instruction Services, and Patricia McNary, electronic services librarian, Sheppard Library, Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciencesâ€“Boston","Objective: In the past few years, librarians have become leaders in teaching the broad concept of 'information literacy.' But how do we know if we are succeeding in helping our students and faculty learn the necessary concepts and skills for lifelong learning? To help determine the effectiveness of our teaching, the instruction librarians decided to initiate a teaching assessment program. Methods: Setting: A small academic health sciences library serving a college of pharmacy and three allied health programs.  Population: Instruction librarians with various backgrounds and years in librarianship. Design: As an initial step in the program, we decided to look at ourselves through our students' eyes and learn from what we observed. We videotaped instruction librarians in various classes, and presented the video to that instructor only. It was up to the individual to share it with the other instructors. Criteria were developed to evaluate each performance. After permission was granted from the videotaped person, the department viewed the videos. Each person then used the criteria to evaluate each librarian. The results were given only to the person involved. Again, if he or she wished to share those results with the group, that was done, and further discussion took place."
"To merge or not to merge: a study on the value of maintaining multiple physical service points in today's changing environment","Kristin Hitchcock, academic resident librarian; Sandra De Groote, AHIP, assistant information services librarian; Richard McGowan, academic resident librarian; and Deirdre Rawls, visiting information services librarian; Information Services, Library of the Health Sciences, University of Illinoisâ€“Chicago","Objective: As electronic resources and online services continue to expand, the Information Services Department examined the value of multiple service points within the library. In order to improve reference services and adapt to new patterns of library usage, merging of service points was examined. Methods: Staff provided evidence of decreased traffic and questioned whether there is still a need for two information services desks, because online services are expanding. A task force examined this issue by interviewing library personnel, studying usage statistics, and considering implications of merging the two physical service points (i.e., patrons' perceptions and expectations, staffing patterns, remodeling, and funding for the transition.) It is expected that the two physical service points will be merged. Results: Nearly 40% fewer questions were asked at the Information Desk in 2002/2003 than in 1997/1998. During this same period Reference Desk questions fell by 51%. Merging desks would likely increase numbers of directional questions fielded by librarians, considering these comprise a significant portion of questions at the Information Desk. Improved signage is being created to reduce this burden. Merging desks would reduce demands on library personnel with primary responsibilities in other departments and would heighten librarians' profile, two concerns expressed during staff interviews. In light of these and other considerations, the service points will be merged into one Information Services Desk. Conclusions: Usage statistics have significantly fallen at both Information Services desks. Merging service points will allow for better use of library personnel, more prominent librarian presence, and more consistent levels of service. This study illustrates the value of regularly reevaluating physical layout in order to provide the best service to library patrons. "
"Duster power: eradicating clutter in preparation for a three library merger and move","Sylvia Contreras, assistant director; Micaela Sullivan- Fowler, head, Historical Collections; and Jodi Iverson, library services assistant; Health Sciences Libraries, University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison; and Marla Cilley, president, FlyLady.net, FlyLady and Company, Ellendale, TN","Objective: This poster will describe the process utilized in decluttering and organizing offices and their occupants, as well as consolidating the files of three existing libraries, in anticipation of merging into one newly constructed facility. Methods: In order to merge and move three libraries efficiently and to minimize the transfer of clutter from existing facilities to the new facility, a sub-committee was formed to develop a plan to eradicate clutter. An office organization plan was adapted from the FlyLady Home Organization System and the Kiss It Goodbye Campaign developed by the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. The Kiss it Goodbye Campaign was launched, and staff were encouraged to weed their work- areas, files, electronic files (email and other documents), and personal belongings for fifteen minutes a day. The daily fifteen minutes sessions allowed staff to take baby-steps toward achieving a clutter-free environment and assist them in establishing routines. The FlyLady Home Organization System was introduced to staff; a record retention policy was enhanced, an archives retention policy was created; office zones were developed; and weekly decluttering missions were established. Units were assigned a weeding representative to assist staff with the weeding, archiving, and recycling process."
"Trading spaces: planning for offsite storage at the University of Californiaâ€“San Diego","Susan Starr, director; Barbara Slater, AHIP, capital projects coordinator; and Anne Prussing, associate director, Collections & Access; Biomedical Library, University of Californiaâ€“San Diego, La Jolla, CA","Objective: An upcoming building project required us to store 50,000 frequently used volumes offsite in an existing storage facility already housing 90,000 low use items. We needed a methodology to (a) identify volumes for storage, (b) determine cost-effective methods to retrieve them for users, and (c) create data that could be used in future offsite storage decisions. Methods: In order to identify volumes for storage, we collected data on the nature and use of the collection, including the age of materials, frequency of reshelving, and availability of electronic access. Demand for retrieval from storage was forecasted using a variety of models, and the resulting data were used to calculate the costs and viability of various retrieval methods; paging was determined to be the most cost- effective method. An online form was created to permit users to request materials from their desktop and permit staff to track the number and titles of requested materials. The move itself was carefully planned and coordinated to assure that the   correct volumes were moved, and OPAC records changed to reflect new locations. Results: Our projections of demand for retrieval were correct; the number of requests varies, averaging around 100 per day but sometimes running as high as 300 per day. Data on the number of volumes paged, the distribution of titles requested, and user acceptance will be presented in the poster as well as some of the unexpected problems that arose and our publicity techniques. Conclusions: Careful planning and analysis can mitigate some of the negative effects of offsite storage."
"PR power for a library on the move","Erika Sevetson, information services librarian; Michael Venner, information services librarian; Sylvia Contreras, assistant director; and Natalie Norcross, AHIP, assistant director; Health Sciences Libraries, University of Wisconsinâ€“ Madison","Purpose: This poster will report on the work of the Public Relations (PR) Committee to prepare staff and constituents for the merger and move of the libraries into a new building. Setting/ Participants: A large academic health sciences library, comprising three locations. Brief Description: The PR Committee was one of several committees formed to prepare for a library move and merger. The committee was charged with ensuring that information regarding the new building and move be communicated internally to all staff and externally to our users and to other campus libraries. Goals (short- and long-term) and ground rules for meetings were set, and communication vehicles as well as a user base (primary, secondary, and tertiary patrons) were defined. A marketing campaign will highlight library services, staff accomplishments/availability, and the new facility. This campaign will be directed at four core groups: students, faculty, researchers, and health care providers employed by the university. Results/Outcome/Conclusion: The PR Committee has been responsible for unifying the messages sent to staff and users. Accomplishments to date include a building Website and FAQ, a 'rumors' page on the staff intranet, several articles in the library newsletter, news items on the libraries' Website, and consistent signage around the libraries. The marketing campaign will use the opportunity provided by a new name, location, and facilities to rebrand our services. The committee's efforts also will be important after the merger of the three libraries, as we continue to focus our message."
"License to fill: seizing the power and providing patrons with materials from a remote storage facility","Melanie J. Norton, interlibrary loan librarian, and Adam S. Vardaman, interlibrary loan lending assistant, Resources Management, and Carol Jenkins, AHIP, FMLA, director, Health Sciences Library; University of North Carolinaâ€“ Chapel Hill","Objective: To review pertinent factors and share the lessons we learned for planning and accessing materials from an off- site storage facility during renovation. Methods: With today's rapidly advancing technology and increasing demand for information, many libraries are experiencing the need for more space. In preparation for renovation at the Health Sciences Library at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill we decided to place all pre-1992 materials in an offsite storage facility. The number identified was 107,800 monographs and 182,200 journals. While these items were in storage, we continued to meet user needs by accessing books and providing articles from stored journals. Data collected on the most-asked-for journal titles as well as the years requested and the total number of requests will be shared. This poster will examine factors to consider when moving a library collection to an off-site facility such as assessing the collection to be moved, the level of service that needs to be provided, and the costs of providing access versus ordering on interlibrary loan. Whether a library is undergoing renovation or trying to free up space, our experience dealing with an off-site storage faclity may be helpful to other health sciences libraries. Results: We underestimated the demand for older material. We received over 10,000 more requests than expected. Twenty- four hour turnaround times became impossible due to the volume of requests. Our service was free. Given free service, patrons could order anything they might use and decide later if the item was needed or not. As a result our workload increased, necessitating extra staff and exceeding cost expectations. The storage facility we used was not equipped to handle the 13,000 requests. As a result, we experienced delays in delivery and frustration with quality of service. Conclusions: Lessons learned from our off-site storage experience: Never underestimate the value of and demand for older materials. Consider a small copy fee to help limit the volume of requests and to offset service costs. Find a storage facility that can accommodate your needs and meet expectations."
"The combined power of metadata standards and controlled vocabularies in the Health Education Assets Library (HEAL)","Shona R. Dippie, associate research librarian and metadata specialist/cataloger, and Sharon E. Dennis, librarian, Eccles Health Sciences Library, University of Utahâ€“Salt Lake City; Sebastian Uijtdehaage, assistant professor, Medicine, and assistant director, Instructional Design and Technology Unit, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of Californiaâ€“ Los Angeles; Chris Candler, associate dean, Education, assistant professor, Medicine, and director, Office of Educational Development and Support, College of Medicine, University of Oklahomaâ€“Oklahoma City; and Sandra A. McIntyre, program manager, David Geffen School of Medicine, Office of the Dean, Center for Education, Development, & Research, University of Californiaâ€“Los Angeles","Objective: The Health Education Assets Library (HEAL), a  digital library project, was undertaken to provide free, high- quality digital materials that meet the needs of today's health sciences educators and learners while respecting ownership and privacy. The project team developed and subsequently refined a custom metadata specification including domain- specific extensions with controlled vocabularies to accommodate new features and more complex multimedia, enhancing accessibility and resource management. Methods: High-quality metadata was crucial to the federated library collection model, which used metadata shared via Open Archives Initiative protocols or other means. Dublin Core compliance facilitated the creation of metadata crosswalks to translate from other standards to the project's custom schema based on the Instructional Management Systems standard. The project schema had twelve required metadata elements including title, contributor, and location. Optional metadata elements designed to meet the needs of the health sciences community included such items as radiograph type, disease/ process, and clinical history. A refined schema and specific policies were developed to address advanced system components, more sophisticated multimedia learning objects, and other issues the team identified during the cataloging and federation-building processes. Controlled vocabularies like the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) were implemented to improve information retrieval and reduce obstacles to metadata record-sharing. Results: According to Website logs, the HEAL metadata schema has been downloaded by over 300 users since its release. Over a half a dozen institutions that are developing internal multimedia resource databases have adapted the schema for local use. We anticipate releasing an updated version based on user feedback by the fall of 2004. HEAL has been designed to facilitate the sharing and accessibility of a wide variety of multimedia resources located on many remote servers. The application provides educators with a single powerful search index and interface through which they can simultaneously query multiple collections. Conclusions: The HEAL metadata schema is the foundation for the digital library; the schema is based on international standards and includes a health sciences specific extension. It is the mechanism for enabling metadata sharing with partner collections. Controlled vocabularies further this goal by enhancing metadata accuracy and consistency. "
"Librarians empowering health science educators: collection development in an international multimedia digital library","Sharon Dennis, librarian, Multimedia Development, Spencer S. Eccles Health Sciences Library, University of Utahâ€“Salt Lake City; Sandra McIntyre, program manager, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of Californiaâ€“Los Angeles; Shona Dippie, librarian, Multimedia Development, Spencer S. Eccles Health Sciences Library, University of Utahâ€“Salt Lake City; Joy Summers-Ables, head, Library Computing and Information Systems, and Shari Clifton, associate professor and head, Reference & Instructional Services, Robert M. Bird Health Sciences Library, University of Oklahomaâ€“Oklahoma City; Sebastian Uijtdehaage, co-director, HEAL Project,  David Geffen School of Medicine, University of Californiaâ€“ Los Angeles; and Chris Candler, co-director, HEAL Project, School of Medicine, University of Oklahomaâ€“Oklahoma City","Objective: An international digital library called the Health Education Assets Library (HEAL) was created to provide health sciences educators with high-quality, freely available multimedia teaching resources. HEAL initially housed a small prototype collection. The formation of a federation of international partners ensured the growth of the collection. A collection development policy guided acquisition of new collections and articulated the planned breadth and depth of the collection. Methods: The collection development policy included a prioritized list of subject areas as well as collection development criteria, metadata policy, accessioning workflow, and terms of participation for each partner. Federation partners were identified through postings on email discussion lists and networking at conferences. Collections were chosen to fill important needs within the digital library. Collections with complete metadata were brought into the digital library in one of two ways, depending on the technical capabilities and preferences of the partner: (1) setting up periodic metadata harvesting using the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) protocol, or (2) building a Web service that returns results on the fly from a partner's collection. Other collections were assigned metadata by the team's cataloger with subject headings using a controlled vocabulary. Unsolicited contributions were accepted through a Web-based form, with basic metadata supplied by the contributor, completing the four-pronged accessioning approach. Results: Three collections were added to the HEAL digital library using a combination of OAI metadata harvesting, Web services, and screen scraping. Justification for each method will be presented. Conclusions: Working with each collection partner required a different set of interactions and technical skills. In some cases, extensive metadata needed to be added to the multimedia items; in other cases, the metadata could be harvested directly from the partner's collection. Cataloging and subject-specific expertise was critical to the success of the project."
"Neuro-Ophthalmology Virtual Education Library (NOVEL) Project","Nancy T. Lombardo, systems librarian, and Valeri Craigle, digital resources librarian, Spencer S. Eccles Health Sciences Library, University of Utahâ€“Salt Lake City","Objective: This poster will present a virtual library project, digitizing and archiving neuro-ophthalmology materials with funding from a three-year Information Systems Grant from NLM. The project aims to digitize significant collections of slides, video, and other media pertaining to neuro- ophthalmology and make them available and searchable to educational users via the Web. Methods: The project is a collaborative effort between an academic health sciences library and the North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society (NANOS) and has been seeded with the collections of two prominent neuro-ophthalmolgists.   Slides, video, and animated material from these collections and from individual faculty around the world will be solicited and digitized to create a comprehensive digital collection covering the core neuro-ophthalmology subject areas. All material will be peer-reviewed by content experts. The collection will be searchable with metadata conforming to the standard set of fields in the Dublin Core. The entire collection will be contributed to the Health Education Assets Library (HEAL), which is a national multimedia database of health sciences multimedia materials. The Neuro-Ophthalmology Virtual Education Library (NOVEL) collection will also be accessible via the Web, where users will be able to browse by subject, collection, or case. This organized and indexed collection will be a valuable asset to neuro-ophthalmology educators, students, and patients. Results: More than 800 slides and 100 videos have been added to the collection. The ContentDM database is used to manage the collection and attach metadata. Neuro-ophthalmology is not well served by Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), so the project team is working with the NANOS to create a thesaurus to serve as controlled vocabulary for subject headings. The NANOS Web Education Committee has begun the peer-review process and procedures are being established to accomplish that task most effectively and efficiently. New collections are being solicited to expand the depth of the project. Conclusions: The NOVEL project is in the first of its three- year, grant-funded period. It is well on the way to establishing a significant collection of digital neuro-ophthalmology materials for educational purposes. Collecting accurate, comprehensive metadata and establishing working vocabularies have been the most challenging and time consuming aspects of the project. "
"Building a better Website through a collaborative Web development process","Barrie E. Hayes, systems development librarian; Barbara Lynn Eades, AHIP, Web development librarian; Michael J. London, Web developer/database administrator; Brian Hilligoss, systems development librarian; Robert Ladd, education media specialist; and Lisa S. Rae, director, Development and Communications; Health Sciences Library, University of North Carolinaâ€“Chapel Hill","Purpose: To present key goals, project stages, and collaborative relationships in a health sciences library Website development process. Setting: Academic health sciences library serving a large state university with multiple health professional schools, hospitals, and biomedical research facilities. In addition to the health sciences library, the university is also served by a main library system and a law library. Brief description: In late 2002, the University of North Carolinaâ€“Chapel Hill Health Sciences Library (HSL) initiated development of a prototype for its new database-driven Website. Prototype development has been led by a core project team and three supporting task forces, and it has followed a methodical, well-documented design process. A core goal specified for the prototype site is integration of content  currently housed by the library's two existing Websites into a single presentation. Integration of the HSL online content with the selected content from the main campus library's Web presentations, especially online subscription resources such as electronic journals, is also a goal. Usability testing has been incorporated at early and later stages of design to ensure the site functions well for users. Collaboration and consultation with library staff, users (through usability testing), and the main library has been central to the success of the development process and achieving project goals. Expected Results/Outcome: Development of a new Website to be released in spring/summer 2004."
"VIVO: the powerful Web Portal of Cornell University's Life Sciences Initiative","Susanne K. Whitaker, AHIP, public services librarian, Flower-Sprecher Veterinary Library, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, and helen-ann brown, AHIP, information services librarian, Weill Cornell Medical Library, Cornell University, New York, NY","Objective: This electronic poster describes the development of a 'Virtual Life Sciences Library,' called VIVO, an extensive Web-based portal of resources and services in support of Cornell's Life Sciences Initiative (LSI). Design: As the center of the campus that brings information resources together, the library formed a committee of science librarians from Ithaca and the Weill Cornell Medical Library in New York City to determine ways of supporting this new Life Sciences Initiative. Described as the 'largest interdisciplinary scientific effort in Cornell's history,' this initiative seeks to enhance and support life sciences research and education by facilitating the collaboration of numerous scientists involved in many diverse areas. The LSI Library Committee began meeting biweekly in Ithaca with a conference call link to New York City in late 2002. A new bioinformatics librarian joined the group in February 2004. One of the first collaborative projects is the development of a unified Website that consolidates multidisciplinary resources into a single interface or portal. Primary users are expected to be current and prospective students (graduate and undergraduate), post docs, faculty, staff, and donors throughout the life sciences. Results/Outcome/Evaluation Methods: VIVO (vivo.library.cornell.edu) intends to provide convenient links to LSI-related web sites from all over campus along with direct access to library resources and services. VIVO features a powerful database that utilizes structured relationships among data elements, or ontologies, for indexing and locating faculty profiles, courses, graduate fields, research centers, facilities, core service technologies, bioinformatics tools and databases, and other related elements. To redesign the prototype main page, a survey has been conducted to assess the site's usability with particular attention to its organization, data element presentation, content, and usefulness to target audiences. This involved several focus group sessions and follow-up interviews. VIVO will be formally unveiled to the Cornell community in early May 2004. Conclusion: Our experience in developing VIVO can serve as a model for others in initiating similar multidisciplinary Web  portals. It also describes how a representative committee of focused creative people with Web design and building skills plus strong public service orientation can communicate and function effectively over long distances."
"Lighting the path to a powerful Web-based tutorial","Richard Nollan, AHIP, special collections librarian; Brenda Faye Green, instructional services librarian; and Lin Wu, reference librarian; Health Sciences Library, University of Tennessee Health Science Centerâ€“Memphis","Objective: In response to the demand for distance education and to bridge the gap between the library's services and the campus community, the library's instructional services, reference services, and campus faculty collaborated to create a Web-based library tutorial to help the campus seize the power of library resources. Descriptions/Methods: The Health Sciences Library serves a comprehensive health science center with six professional schools with approximately 2,000 students. The tutorial helps the campus population increase their basic library skills, find library resources, use the Web, cite sources, and use online pathfinders. This poster will share the overall development and assessment of the tutorial. Pros and cons of using a course management system (Blackboard) and Web development tools will be shared. The collaborative effort of assessing, designing, and evaluating the tutorial provides a powerful incentive, and the authors expect this will lead to further development of additional modules for the tutorial. Focus groups will provide review and feedback. The value of collaborating with several departments to accomplish the goal is also demonstrated."
"Library Web development: a decade in review","Mary E. Piorun, AHIP, associate director, Library Systems, and Robert Vander Hart, electronic resources librarian, Lamar Soutter Library, UMass Medical School, Worcester, MA","Objective: This poster examines how academic medical libraries have presented their Websites over the past decade. (1) How have advances in Web technologies influenced the 'look and feel' of the Website? (2) What other developments contributed to the evolution of medical library Websites? (3) How has the librarian's role in Web development changed in the last ten years? Methods: Reviewing the history of the Web and developments in new technology, we will note significant turning points in the design of our own library Website and that of other institutions of a similar size and mission. Using data and images from the Way Back Machine at www.archive.org, we will plot how changes in technology effect what information is presented, page layout, and usability. We will examine how changes in librarianship and the 'information explosion' have helped the medical library web site progress. Results: From examining our own Website history, we have determined that we were slow to implement new design technologies. Many of the technologies that were initially incorporated into the Web page design improved on graphical elements at first. Improvements on layout, searching, and form design soon followed. In 2000, a new underlying database   structure (using Cold Fusion) was added to the Website that allowed staff to better manage the large number of e-resources the library provided. Once a full-time position dedicated to Web management was created, our Website development was focused on layout and usability. Conclusions: From looking at other Websites of similar size, we have determined that many libraries' Websites progressed first as an 'online directory' providing basic information, then to a page that started to offer services such as request forms and links to an OPAC and/or MEDLINE, and finally to a dynamic site with electronic books, journals, and databases. Many institutions offer customized pages for individual users. Additional research is recommended."
"If you build it will they use it? Giving patrons control of their library Website experience","Michelle Frisque, head, Information Systems; Steve Hunt, Web librarian; Linda Walton, associate director; and James Shedlock, AHIP, director; Galter Health Sciences Library; Jon Handler, associate professor, and Michael Gillam, assistant clinical professor, Emergency Medicine Division, Department of Medicine; Northwestern University, Chicago, IL","Objective: The library recently launched a new Website, which was created to help the busy health care professionals manage their information needs. The overall objective of this project is to measure the usage of the customizable tools developed for this site and to determine how and if different user groups take advantage of the customization features. Methods: The customization tools that will be evaluated are the File Cabinet, a place where users can store and organize their favorite links; My E-Resources, a collection of the users' favorite e-resources; Quick Search, a metasearch tool; and Stay Current, which allows users to stay on top of the most recent journal literature. We will use quantitative and qualitative data collected over a six-month period to illustrate who is customizing, based on patron status and department affiliation and which tools they are customizing. Log files, database records, and user feedback in the form of surveys and one-on- one interviews will be analyzed to assess the popularity and effectiveness of the tools. Once the data are collected and analyzed, they will be used to improve the features as well as identify new tools that could be created for different user populations. Results: Preliminary results show that approximately 15% of the users registered to use the library's Website have customized at least one section. My E-Resources is the most popular customized section followed by the Stay Current, metasearch and finally the File Cabinet. Students and faculty customize more then any other group. Residents are the least likely to customize. A user survey was recently completed on the effectiveness of the customization tools. The results of this survey as well as other data will be evaluated to judge the effectiveness of the customization tools for each of our user groups. Conclusions: The library's Website was created to help our users manage their information needs. By evaluating the quantitative and qualitative data gathered, we are learning   whether the tools we created assist our users and how to improve them to continue our goal of helping them tame the information beast."
"Amplifying usability testing: harness the power of Camtasia Studio","Linda O'Dwyer, education librarian; Stephanie C. Kerns, head, Education and Outreach Services; Mark Berendsen, education librarian; Kurt Munson, head, User Services; Cheryl Powell, library assistant, and Linda Walton, associate director; Galter Health Sciences Library, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL","Objective: The library previously conducted Website usability testing using the 'intensive note-taking' method. Communicating user difficulties effectively and accurately to the Web designers has been problematic. Our goal was to find and assess a more reliable usability testing method, so everyone involved in the Website redesignâ€”designers, programmers, and testersâ€”could more objectively share the users' experiences of the Website. Methods: The library conducted usability testing of its new Website in fall 2003 using TechSmith's Camtasia Studio software. We used a similar set of tasks to those used in a previous usability study held in May 2002. This allowed us to obtain a correlative assessment of users' perceptions of the library Website and to see how the new testing method compares. Ten users were tested separately. Camtasia Studio was used to record each user's screen, clicks, and speech during the test. We watched and listened to each user's media file and extracted information for a usability report. We replayed problematic user interactions with the website for the programmers and staff involved in the design process. This meant that those not present at the user tests could interpret and understand more clearly why a particular section of the Website caused usability problems. Results: The test facilitators submitted a usability test report to the Website designers. In places where confusion arose as to the nature of the problem encountered by the user, the designers were able to play back the relevant portions of the Camtasia files. This effectively placed the designers in the same room as the test subjects. Conclusions: The use of Camtasia Studio may lengthen the usability reporting process, because the test facilitators and Website designers may have to replay portions of the file. However, the increased objectivity of the test and the improved accuracy of the results make Camtasia Studio an invaluable tool for usability testing."
"Sharing the code: the Health SmartLibrary experience","Steven Hunt, Web programmer, Galter Health Sciences Library, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL","Objective: The Health SmartLibrary Website features a customizable interface, a current awareness service, a personal file cabinet, and a multi-resource searching tool. It was completed under a grant from the National Library of Medicine (IS Grant #1 G08 LM07051-01A1). Our goal was to share the  code for these features with interested libraries and to learn what we could about such cooperation. Methods: Phase I: The Health SmartLibrary was presented and discussed at MLA and other meetings while still under development, and several informal contacts were made with colleagues interested in doing similar things at their own institutions. These colleagues were in similarly situated institutions and had some programming experience. They agreed to take the code we wrote, try to incorporate it into their own projects, and share their experiences as to the ease and effectiveness of implementation. Phase II: Next, we determined to make the code generally available to any library interested in downloading it. In order to make the code as portable as possible, each function was broken out into its own module designed to work as a plug-in to an existing Website. The modules were made available to any librarian who registered with us and agreed to give structured feedback. Results: Several librarians with varying levels of programming experience from other medical libraries took our code and tinkered with it on their own sites. Their experiences differed in many ways but most found they had to do considerable work to accommodate their existing environments. Not all modules worked as a simple 'plug-and-play.' In most cases, additional consultations had to be undertaken beyond the original documentation provided. Conclusions: We conclude that the work involved in making the various modules easily portable and adaptive to other environments was beyond our expectations, and in fact, would probably account for more time and work than the original programming itself. This is not to say that the participants' experiences were not instructive or valuable, or that other such code-sharing projects could not be successful, but the commitment of time and resources should not be underestimated."
"Power management: seize the crisis and make it work for you","Deborah Bonelli, library director, and Lisa Lin, AHIP, reference librarian, Medical Library, St. Barnabas Hospital, Bronx, NY","Objective: The resignation of the electronic resources coordinator created a crisis for staff and patrons. Remaining staff lacked confidence about providing multimedia services. Patrons expressed anxiety about losing a valued library service. This crisis produced two dilemmas. How to assure library users of continued multimedia services and how to train staff, bolster morale, and market library multimedia expertise to the institution. Methods: Motivating and training staff to create a tribute to the electronic resources coordinator in the form of a farewell movie resolved the crisis. The small hospital library staff learned to use iMovie, a powerful digital editing software, a compact Canon digital camera, and QuickTime Pro, to produce an eight-minute tribute to be presented at a hospital- wide farewell party attended by staff, patrons, and key hospital administrators.  Results: The project showcased the work of library staff who would soon be responsible for filling the role vacated by a key staff member. In the process, the remaining staff learned new skills, morale was bolstered, and their creativity and expertise were showcased to existing and potential users as well as to administrators. Existing clients were assured of continued multimedia services begun by the library earlier that year. Conclusions: Seizing the crisis and creatively transforming it into a positive and productive experience for staff resulted in a greater sense of staff involvement in work and the continued reliance of outside departments on the library's multimedia services."
"Seize the power of your patrons to promote your library","Amy G. Buhler, AHIP, reference librarian; Dwight Bennett, Webmaster; and Ned Davis, marketing and publications coordinator; Health Science Center Libraries, University of Floridaâ€“Gainesville","Objective: For an academic health science center (HSC) to succeed and flourish, getting administrative leaders to feel personally connected with the library is essential to ensure that support of the library is always in their plans and budgets. This poster will detail our library's 'RxEAD: Prescription for Knowledge' poster campaign, which promotes our continuing positive relationship with the faculty, staff, and students. Methods: HSC deans were asked to pose with a book that was important to them personally or professionally. These pictures of the leadership promoting library resources were produced as twenty-by-thirty-inch posters and placed in library display cases. Bookmarks with miniatures of the posters and library services information continue to be distributed to faculty, staff, and students. The RxEAD posters are not tied to a specific month or event but function more as a general library promotion and will be employed at several events during the coming year. We anticipate our gallery of Powerful People Who Love The Library will continue to grow. One administrator believes this will introduce students to university leadership and promote the libraries. Results: We achieved full participation from the HSC colleges; nearly every dean and program head personally participated. Several participants requested personal copies. Bookmarks of the posters were also successfulâ€”hundreds of each were distributed at various library and college functions. Another large-scale distribution is planned for the fall term. All the participants said they were honored to appear on a poster, and thanked us for the opportunity. Once posters were on display, other faculty and administration members asked about participating in next year's campaign. Conclusions: Although hard to quantify, we feel this campaign was very successful. We noted many positive comments and reaction to the posters and are certain of the value of making and reinforcing connections between the library and deans, administrators, faculty, staff, and students. One final measure of success: the RxEAD poster campaign won first place in this year's National Medical Librarians Month Creative Promotions Awards."
"Going for the green$$$$","Martha M. Studaker, AHIP, library director; Phyllis L. Reams, librarian I; and Sharon J. Williams, librarian I; Hamady Health Sciences Library, Hurley Medical Center, Flint, MI","Purpose: This poster demonstrates how a hospital library generates thousands of dollars in funds, enabling them to purchase without the administrative 'red tape.' Setting: It is a city hospital, but receives no funding from the city. Market share is split among three hospitals with the city hospital caring for 80% of uncompensated care. Every year, since 1995, the budget has been cut or remained flat. Description: The common refrain 'they should realize the worth of the library and provide funds accordingly,' does not take into account that while the library might truly be appreciated, money only goes so far. Charged with planning for the future financial viability of the library, an Endowment Fund was established. This was the catalyst for fundraising endeavors. The Endowment Funds currently total $276,000. An Annual Ball made the library a beneficiary of $107,000. Supplementing the solicited donations were small library fundraisers: bake sales, old book sales, raffles, and even a library cookbook. Additionally, since 1994, the library began fundraising in earnest, raising over $85,000 in 8 years. It began with a Hurleyopoly game. Then there were 'home shows gone corporate.' The library currently sponsors 10 fundraisers each year averaging $12,000 to $16,000 per year. These sales involve little time and effort from the library staff. The keys to success are institutional cooperation, location, payroll deduction, percentage negotiation, and products. This money translates into power: the power to purchase."
"The Arizona Health Sciences Library's 'Ask a Health Librarian' Project: marketing our new virtual reference chat service","Bruce Chandler, support systems analyst; Hannah Fisher, AHIP, librarian; Fred Heidenreich, librarian; David K. Howse, assistant librarian; Nga Nguyen, senior library specialist; Joan Schlimgen, librarian; Stefan Walz, support systems analyst; and Cathy Wolfson, librarian; Information Services, Arizona Health Sciences Library, University of Arizonaâ€“Tucson","Objective: This poster will report on how marketing efforts affected the usage trends of the Arizona health library's virtual reference chat service. Methods: The Arizona Health Sciences Library (AHSL) is a large academic health sciences library serving diverse populations, including faculty, staff, and students of the colleges of medicine, nursing, pharmacy, and public health, in addition to the practicing health professionals and residents of Arizona. The Information Services staff worked jointly with the head of access services to design and implement a marketing plan for its new virtual reference service, called 'Ask a Health Librarian,' which included a new 'chat' feature. The AHSL launched the 'Ask a Health Librarian' service, which uses Docutek VRLPlus software, to enable patrons to    email and chat interactively with librarians, in September of 2003. Aggressive marketing of the new service was purposefully avoided in the beginning for two reasons: to enable staff to become comfortable with the new technology, and because it was difficult to determine how resource- intensive the service would be to support. Due to initial low use of the chat feature, it became clear that a marketing strategy was needed. Information Services staff collaborated with the head of access services to create posters, bookmarks, colorful Web banners, and icons; to publish news items; and to discuss the service and its availability in various library orientations and instructional classes. It is expected that usage statistics will rise as marketing efforts intensify. Usage statistics will be evaluated against a timeline depicting various marketing strategies. Docutek VRLPlus's built-in patron satisfaction survey will provide valuable data on how the service is being received as well."
"Publicity juggernaut at the University of Maryland Health Sciences and Human Services Library","Diane Fuller, information specialist; Alexa Mayo, AHIP, assistant director, Information and Instructional Services; MJ Tooey, AHIP, executive director; and Bradley Gerhart, information technology support specialist; Health Sciences and Human Services Library, University of Marylandâ€“Baltimore","Objective: This poster reports on traditional and innovative methods used to promote and market library resources, services, and programming to the University of Marylandâ€“ Baltimore community. The Health Sciences and Human Services Library (HS/HSL) of the University of Marylandâ€“ Baltimore is a large, academic library serving the schools of pharmacy, dentistry, medicine, nursing, and social work and the University of Maryland Medical Center in an urban setting. The HS/HSL also provides selective outreach to area hospitals and library members. Library Administration and Public Services Divisions are responsible for content. Methods: Promotion of the library's services and resources and creating an awareness of the value that the library brings to the campus is essential to its long-term health. This poster will report on a variety of promotional methods used by the HS/ HSL. Successes and a variety of challenges to these promotional activities will also be demonstrated. The HS/HSL uses a systematic and organized approach to marketing and publicity. This poster will describe these approaches, as well as impediments to our success."
"Unearthing the power of data mining to evaluate and manage library collections","Esther E. Carrigan, AHIP, deputy director; Nancy Burford, database and digital services librarian; and Robin R. Sewell, research liaison and reference librarian; Medical Sciences Library, Texas A&M Universityâ€“College Station","Objective: Collection budgets are greatly stressed in the world of complementary print and electronic resources. Client preferences for full-text journals continue. Purchase of redundant print and online material must be justified. New bibliographic techniques are needed to maximize intellectual  access and use of collection resources. This poster demonstrates the data mining achieved and its use as the basis for collection decisions. Methods: Data was brought together from a variety of sources and analyzed. LIBQUAL customer surveys provided a baseline for satisfaction and expectations for the collection. Print usage statistics for the past 5 years were combined with subscription costs, online usage statistics and broad subject focus information. All titles with fewer than 10 uses per year or a cost per use greater than $30 were evaluated for possible cancellation. Labels were placed on current print issues to alert users to proposed cancellations. Bibliographic and usage data were extracted from the integrated library system for a complete monograph collection evaluation. A data file extracted from the integrated library system was used to populate a list of electronic resources and support a subject presentation of full-text resources on the library Website. Results: Decisions were made to convert nearly a third of current print journal subscriptions to online only. Print only subscriptions with little use were cancelled. Review of the monograph collection resulted in the withdrawal of significant numbers of monographs and enhanced records for many of the items retained. Conclusions: We were successful in our attempt to make collection decisions based on data gathering and analysis. Feedback sought from clients through comment cards, email, focus groups, and surveys strongly affirmed collection decisions made."
"A capital improvement: the remodeling of an academic medical library's reference collection","Nancy A. Bianchi, health sciences librarian, and Carroll Guitar, health sciences librarian, Dana Medical Library, University of Vermontâ€“Burlington","Objective: This poster describes a contemporary approach to revitalizing a traditional paper reference collection in an academic medical library. Methods: The reference collectionâ€”traditional print resources, standing like an island in a sea of glitzy electronic databasesâ€”we all have one in our libraries, yet its resources often are undervalued for their scholarly content and vastly underutilized by our patrons. When the library was forced to move to temporary quarters, it became all too apparent that the time was ripe for some capital improvements to the reference collection. What followed was a systematic review of each title on the shelves of reference. Our ultimate goal is to eventually move a contemporary reference collection, which is responsive to both academic and clinical information needs, into our new state-of-the-art facility. Results: Our sixteen-month long collection review project witnessed a much needed reexamination of the collection development philosophy, quality improvements to the supporting infrastructure, and a unique approach to blending a document's current Web site with its traditional paper resource, where available. Conclusions: These capital improvements to our traditional reference collection have paved the way for remodeling and  building a reference collection for the 21st century in an academic medical library."
"Core journal evaluation study: method and data analysis","Jane L. Blumenthal, AHIP, assistant dean, Knowledge Management, and director, and Vani K. Murthy, assistant director, Collections and Systems, Dahlgren Memorial Library, Georgetown University, Washington, DC","Objective: This poster will present results of a journal assessment study conducted at an academic medical library. The purpose of this study was to identify a set of core journals by using a method that encouraged faculty participation and emphasized user needs. This was to ensure that library funds are initially appropriated for journals that are of greatest importance to users. Setting/Population: This study was conducted in an academic medical library that serves approximately 5,000 students, faculty members, staff, and physicians. Around 750 faculty members were invited to participate in the evaluation of journals. Methodology: In 2000/01, the medical library began the process of developing a core journal study. Factors to be used in the study were carefully selected and were used in a formula that was applied to the entire journal collection. Impact factor, half life, Brandon/Hill rating, faculty rating, faculty publication data, cost per use, interlibrary loan data, and indexing information were some of the factors used in the formula to determine the core collection. The SAS program was used to determine the relationship between some of these factors. Relationships between the different factors used in the formula will be analyzed and displayed graphically on this poster. Results: Journals were sorted in descending order based on the formula and a core journal line was drawn. Titles above the line were identified as core journals and were associated with a high impact factor and faculty rating. While many journals below the core line had low impact factors, faculty rated some of them as essential. A closer examination showed that these were mostly new titles or nursing journals. Data analysis also revealed that there was no correlation between faculty rating and the Brandon/Hill rating or the impact factors. However, there was a correlation between journal usage and faculty rating. Conclusions: This study was successful in defining the core collection, and was helpful in identifying journals to discontinue or retain only in electronic format. Data analysis suggests that future journals' selection cannot depend primarily on Brandon/Hill rating or the impact factor but must draw heavily on faculty recommendations."
"Power through communication: using the Web in a journal evaluation project","Robin Klein, digital resources librarian, Collection Development Department; Patricia G. Hinegardner, AHIP,   Web manager, Information and Instructional Services; and Brad Gerhart, information technology support specialist, Computing and Technology Services; Health Sciences and Human Services Library, University of Marylandâ€“Baltimore","Objective: This poster will highlight the development of a Journal Evaluation Project Website, which the library used to communicate journal subscription concerns to the campus community. It will also provide information on the Web-based survey used to enlist campus participation in the review of possible journals to be cancelled. Methods: The phenomenal rise in journal subscription costs and state budget problems have had a negative impact on our library budget, making it necessary to re-evaluate the journal collection. The Website was developed to make the campus community aware of the issue and to encourage participation in the solution. It informed them of current trends in journal subscription costs and introduced publishing alternatives. A Web-based survey was used to enlist faculty, staff, and student participation in the journal deselection process. This poster will highlight the process of developing the survey and the site. It will also summarize the outcome of the survey. Results: The site was launched April 7, 2003. The survey was open for voting through May 16, 2003. The Website later announced the survey results. The number of faculty and students who voted totaled 207. Of 573 titles, 453 received votes to retain. 371 journals were cancelled based on the survey and subsequent review by librarians. Conclusions: The Web-based presentation for the Journal Evaluation Project was a successful mechanism for informing users and obtaining reliable feedback to proposed journal cuts. This Web-based format will be used again this year as budget constraints and unsustainable journal subscription costs collide at the library. "
"Linking technology's power to deliver needed articlesto undergraduate nursing students","Marcia Henry, health sciences librarian, University Library, California State Universityâ€“Northridge","Objective: Investigate the effectiveness of the California State Universityâ€“Northridge Library's new SFX linking technology to meet the document delivery needs of the undergraduate nursing program Methods: This retrospective cohort study will analyze article requests made by nursing students using the CINAHL document delivery program funded by a California Wellness Foundation grant from 1999 to the present in light of the university library's newest linking technology. To date, the CINAHL document delivery program has delivered over 1,200 articles from over 200 nursing and medical journals. The library recently acquired ExLibris' SFX article linker service. This study has important contributions to both user education and collection development. It will identify which journal titles requested over the last 4 years are now readily available in the library's growing electronic journal collection. It is apparent  that the need for CINAHL document delivery service has dramatically dropped since its heaviest use in 1999 and 2000. Initially, the decrease in requests was linked to OCLC's ability to connect to the library catalog directly from the CINAHL record in FirstSearch. This study will analyze the database of requested articles against the new SFX screens to identify how well the new SFX technology can contribute to student success in finding the needed articles in the library's growing full text databases. Samples of effective SFX screens as well as emerging problematic issues will be identified."
"Tell the story in a powerful way: medical library collection management","Carole Francq Gall, development officer and manager, Print Journals, Ruth Lilly Medical Library, Indiana University School of Medicineâ€“Indianapolis, and Jane F. Corbett, trainer, Training, Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN","Objective: The medicine library has effectively managed 2,000 active subscriptions with little faculty complaint. Over $1 million was saved through a decade of cancellation decisions, which saved the subscription price and inflationary increases. Also, the library refreshed its collection with 400 new subscriptions. How can we tell this success story in a powerful way to faculty and potential donors? Methods: In MS Excel, a formula was devised to calculate the cumulative savings from cancellations over a decade, including inflation. The formula combines current year savings, plus the prior year's cumulative savings, plus inflation on the prior year's cumulative savings. The same formula figured the new subscriptions cumulative costs. The average inflation was taken from the EBSCO Serials Prices in the chart for the Academic Medical Library Cost History. The overall net savings should show the importance of using metrics for publicity, but the figures would still be hard for laypeople to interpret. The spreadsheet Chart Wizard should be an easy, effective method to change the metrics into intuitive charts for promotion and fundraising. Applying adult learning principles to the resulting charts and related content should modify the outcomes in MS PowerPoint and Web page formats intended for laypersons. Results: We found that the standard three-dimensional pie chart was the most compatible with our data; also the standard chart options in Excel were all that was necessary for an impressive presentation of the data. The MS Excel worksheet had multiple levels of row and column labels, which we renamed carefully, because the labels transferred to the chart legends. Copy and paste were used to import the finished chart into a PowerPoint and a Web page, then the library staff and others were asked to preview the results and give us feedback. We are confident in using the charts with prospective donors Conclusions: MS Excel Chart Wizard is easy to use. The resulting charts are compatible with and easily imported into PowerPoint presentations and Web pages. The charts are colorful, easy to interpret, and contribute to a professional image of the library they represent."
"'But we made the easy cuts last year!' Staffing the library","Jane Fama, associate director, Access Services, Lamar Soutter Library, UMass Medical School, Worcester, MA","Objective: After dealing with three major budget cuts in FY03, the Lamar Soutter Library faced additional reductions for FY04. The Management Team realized that drastic journal and staffing cuts were on the horizon. Concerns for the collection and for continued customer service called for creative solutions. This poster chronicles the process we used to institute the changes that were necessary to keep our public service desks staffed. Methods: We anticipated the loss of 3.5 FTE circulation staff and 1.0 reference staff, all part time employees whose major responsibilities were stacks maintenance and staffing the library on weekends and evenings. It was clear that we did not have enough bodies to staff the library at our current level of 106 hours per week, but how many hours could we cut? We used a three pronged approach to arrive at a solution. 1. Looked at the top twenty-five medical and health sciences  libraries for benchmarking.  2. Gathered daily usage statistics every two hours for several  months to determine the times that the library was most heavily used.  3. Developed several possible scenarios using current  circulation staff as well as staff from other areas of the library.  Results: Benchmarking revealed that, at 106.5 hours, we were open well above the mean of 94 hours per week. Usage statistics identified the times and days when reduction of hours would be least disruptive to our clientele's needs. We created several alternative schedules with hours ranging from the mean to 12 hours under the mean. Using the staffing levels that we anticipated after the cuts, we identified problem timesâ€”times when we had no desk coverageâ€”and proposed staffing solutions for each scenario using resources from technical services, where processing time had been reduced due to budget cuts and process reengineering. Conclusions: Our optimal opening time was 86 hours per week. This 19% reduction in hours went into effect on July 1, 2003. Although the students were not happy with losing library hours, the justification was clear and the process by which we developed a plan was sound.

Maintaining a quality journal collection in tough budget times","Barbara Combes Ingrassia, AHIP, associate director, Technical Services, and Elaine Russo Martin, AHIP, director, Library Services, The Lamar Soutter Library, University of Massachusetts Medical Schoolâ€“Worcester","Objective: After dealing with three major budget cuts in FY03, The Lamar Soutter Library faced additional reductions for FY04. After brainstorming, the management team realized that drastic journal and staffing cuts were on the horizon. Concerns for the collection and for continued customer service called for creative solutions. The poster will examine the measures taken to preserve a quality journals collection. Methods: After compiling and sorting print and online usage statistics gathered over an eighteen-month period, low-use titles were identified for possible cancellation in order to meet the revised budget guidelines. A spreadsheet was prepared including information concerning annual subscription/ licensing costs, publisher, publication frequency, appearance on core titles lists, availability via databases, inclusion in aggregation packages, subscription requirements for electronic packages, availability in nearby affiliate institutions, and usage and cost-per-use statistics. The list was refined over several months, and distributed to the faculty for input. The director of library services attended various committee meetings to answer questions and gather feedback. A final list of titles, with total projected cost savings, was compiled. There were elements of both 'art' and 'science' in this process. Results: The results of this process were unexpected. The faculty had been involved in the process, and understood the ramifications of massive journal cuts. As a group, the faculty Council protested to the School Administration about the planned cutsâ€”and the administration gave the needed funds to the library to pay for the journals slated to be cut. Conclusions: Although a 'happy ending' is not always possible, a carefully planned review process, utilizing as much hard data as possible, and keeping the users informed at each stage, can benefit the library as it seeks to provide quality resources in support of the school's mission."
