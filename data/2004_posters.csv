Methods: An interdepartmental informatics curriculum committee was formed to review in which courses informatics concepts were taught throughout the four-year curriculum and to draft updated learning objectives. Through this faculty- librarian collaboration, we identified one preclinical course and one clinical clerkship in which to pilot an instructional intervention and tailored assignment for assessing student competencies. Faculty and librarians worked together to identify outcomes and indicators, create relevant assignments, and teach students information retrieval and information management skills. Results: In the 'Introduction to Health Care' course, all first- year students completed a community health informatics project. Twenty-five percent attended a voluntary library help session or sought librarian assistance in finding county-level data. Qualitative observation of 39 presentations indicated that all 39 students found information relevant to their assignment. Only 44% clearly documented their sources, making it difficult to objectively assess the quality of the information. In the third-year family medicine clerkship, faculty-librarian teams taught evidence-based medicine workshops. Students completed a clinical question worksheet and documented search strategies. During this pilot phase, the worksheets were not graded. Student feedback provided additional insights. Conclusions: Faculty-librarian collaboration aided the development of appropriate, relevant assignments for preclinical and clinical education. Coteaching by faculty- librarian teams emphasized the integrated nature of informatics competencies and enhanced the teaching experience. More work is needed to develop appropriate assessment strategies."
