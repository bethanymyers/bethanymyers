Blumenthal, AHIP, director and assistant dean, Knowledge Management, Dahlgren Memorial Library; Jeffrey M. Weinfeld, assistant professor, Department of Family Medicine; and Marcus A. Banks, AHIP, NLM associate fellow, and Janette Shaffer, education coordinator, Dahlgren Memorial Library; Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC","Objective: We collaborated with medical school faculty to develop a curriculum-integrated posttest model to assess informatics competencies in the medical school curriculum. Methods: An interdepartmental informatics curriculum committee was formed to review in which courses informatics concepts were taught throughout the four-year curriculum and to draft updated learning objectives. Through this faculty- librarian collaboration, we identified one preclinical course and one clinical clerkship in which to pilot an instructional intervention and tailored assignment for assessing student competencies. Faculty and librarians worked together to identify outcomes and indicators, create relevant assignments, and teach students information retrieval and information management skills. Results: In the 'Introduction to Health Care' course, all first- year students completed a community health informatics project. Twenty-five percent attended a voluntary library help session or sought librarian assistance in finding county-level data. Qualitative observation of 39 presentations indicated that all 39 students found information relevant to their assignment. Only 44% clearly documented their sources, making it difficult to objectively assess the quality of the information. In the third-year family medicine clerkship, faculty-librarian teams taught evidence-based medicine workshops. Students completed a clinical question worksheet and documented search strategies. During this pilot phase, the worksheets were not graded. Student feedback provided additional insights. Conclusions: Faculty-librarian collaboration aided the development of appropriate, relevant assignments for preclinical and clinical education. Coteaching by faculty- librarian teams emphasized the integrated nature of informatics competencies and enhanced the teaching experience. More work is needed to develop appropriate assessment strategies.""Power of improved practice: taking information management education to the next level","Jeanne Sadlik, coordinator, Research & Education Services, and Logan Ludwig, associate dean, Health Sciences Library/ Media Services/Telemedicine, Loyola Health Sciences Library, Stritch School of Medicine, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL","Objective: To integrate knowledge-based information into the curriculum by using an electronic learning management system and to demonstrate students' competencies in searching databases for evidence-based-medicine literature. Methods: Setting: Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine (SSOM) Maywood, Illinois Population: 130 third-year medical students Project Description: Since 1995, librarians held one-hour sessions with all third-year medical students at the start of clerkship rotations in July. In these sessions, students were taught research techniques necessary to identify evidence- based-medicine (EBM) literature. This class focused on teaching the students to use logical, analytical thinking combined with advanced searching skills to search MEDLINE. These skills enable the students to search the literature and critically evaluate articles identified to support their clinical decisions. In 2003, the librarians developed a computer-based learning (CBL) module, 'Searching for Evidence-Based- Medicine Literature,' to take the place of the instructor-led sessions. The CBL consisted of thirty-six slides and a ten- question posttest (random questions from a pool of 20) followed by survey questions. This module supports SSOM's move toward competency-based education. The data collected from the completion of the CBL demonstrate the competencies of the students in searching the literature for EBM information. All third-year students were notified by email of the need to complete the CBL by the end of July. Instructions for accessing the system were included. Results: One hundred thirty third-year medical students completed the evidence-based medicine CBL module. The average test score was 90%; 124 of the 130 students passed the posttest on the first try; 23 students attempted to complete the posttest without looking at the course material. Out of these 23, 20 passed the test on the first attempt. Sixty-three percent of the students found the information presented helpful in understanding how to search for EBM literature; 84% preferred completing the CBL module to an instructor-led class. Conclusion: This pilot study showed that using a CBL module was an effective way to teach research techniques necessary to identify EBM literature. Because of the success of this program, in the future, all third-year students will be required to complete the CBL module."
